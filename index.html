      <h2>About Sean and Tomas</h2>
      <p>
        Sean Grogan and Tomas Brogan are Afro-Luxembourgish songwriters with Irish ancestry whose
        lyrical ballads and satirical songs explore exile, identity, devotion,
        and drink. Their work blends their interpretation of the Irish folk tradition, nodding fondly to the Clancy Brothers and Finbar Furey, with
        a contemporary diasporic voice that resounds from the streets of Luxembourg and Africa. That voice that sometimes strays into unknown places, into little known lands, with which they are intimately familiar.
