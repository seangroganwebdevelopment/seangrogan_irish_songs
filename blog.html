      <h2>How I Met Brogan</h2>

      <p>Memories of Brogan...</p>

      <span id="entry1" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 How I Met Brogan by Grogan</p>

        <p>I first met Brogan in a translation booth in Luxembourg. Yes — you read that right. Not at a pub session, not
          on a windswept Kerry road, not in the cell of a revolutionary monastery — but in a sterile European Union
          conference room where they were arguing about pig subsidies in seventeen languages.</p>
        <p>He leaned into his microphone and whispered, “This place needs a bodhrán.”</p>
        <p>I didn’t laugh. I wrote it down. That was the first line of the first song we ever wrote together. It was
          never released. We called it <em>“Ballad of the Bureaucrat’s Pig.”</em></p>
        <p>Brogan believed poetry belonged in places that didn’t want it. On roundabouts. In footnotes. In the gaps
          between tired words and missed chances. I think that’s why we got along.</p>
        <p>We came from opposite ends of the same bog:<br>
          He — musical instinct incarnate. A man who could coax melody from a radiator pipe and claimed his earliest
          influence was the sound of rain on a caravan roof.<br>
          Me — a compulsive scribbler. Raised on mass cards and protest songs, obsessed with rhyme, meter, myth, and
          mistakes.</p>
        <p>Together, we wrote. Songs about emigrants and eccentrics. Donkeys and industrial schoolboys. Priests who saw
          visions and women who saw through us. Some songs made people laugh. Some made them weep. A few did both in the
          same verse.</p>

        <p>We bickered, of course. He liked first takes. I liked revisions. He believed in chaos; I believed in
          craftsmanship. But the music found a way through. Always.</p>

        <p>Then one day, he disappeared.</p>

        <p>Not like in a dramatic movie. No farewell note. No tragic accident. Just... gone. His fiddle left behind. His
          boots still muddy. A cupboard full of scribbled half-verses and jars of pickled beets he insisted were good
          for “melodic tone.”</p>

        <p>For a while, I thought he’d faked his own death for publicity. Then I thought he’d gone feral and was living
          off-grid in Donegal, collaborating with seals. I still think that might be true.</p>

        <p>In the years since, I’ve kept writing. But the songs come differently now. Slower. More haunted. Like they’re
          trying to tell me something he forgot to say.</p>

        <p>Recently, I opened the old suitcase where we kept our lyrics — the Grogan & Brogan Songwriting Stash. Dozens
          of them. Some complete, some half-born, others written in languages neither of us spoke.</p>

        <p>And I thought: I can’t let this vanish.</p>

        <p>I’m nearly fifty. Too old for delusions, too young to give up. I want to publish the songs. Record them. Tour
          them across Ireland, Europe, and Africa — every place we ever dreamed aloud. Not for fame. Not even for
          closure.</p>

        <p>For Brogan.</p>

        <p>For the boy who opened his lunchbox to find a rodent and inspired a ballad.</p>

        <p>For the girl who heard <em>“Roses and Poitín”</em> and laughed through her tears.</p>

        <p>For Rainbow the donkey, who brayed on key.</p>

        <p>For the songs that keep arriving, unbidden and beautiful, like drunken angels.</p>

        <p>If you see Brogan — tell him the music’s waiting.</p>

        <p>Tell him I kept his boots.</p>

        <p>And tell him the gigs are starting soon.</p>

      <h2>Songs from the Stash — The Tour Begins</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on May 29, 2025</p>
      <p><em>“Somewhere in a suitcase under my stairs, Brogan’s spirit was waiting.”</em> I never meant to go back on
        the road...</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-brogan-tour-begins-small-regenerated.jpg"
        alt="Grogan and Brogan meet in a translation booth with guitar and notebook" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;">

      <span id="entry2" style="display:none;">

        <p>But something started stirring this year — a sense that time was no longer patient. That the songs Brogan and
          I wrote — scribbled on receipts, beer mats, and prayer cards — weren’t just memories. They were blueprints.
          Prophecies. Ghosts.</p>

        <p>So I opened the suitcase.</p>

        <p>Inside?<br>
          The Grogan & Brogan stash.</p>

        <p>Forty-seven songs we never released.<br>
          Twelve we only ever sang to donkeys.<br>
          Five written during a blackout in Ballymahone.<br>
          And one we swore we’d only perform “if the world started falling apart.”</p>

        <p><strong>Well… here we are.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>🎶 What Is Songs from the Stash?</strong><br>
          It’s not a greatest hits tour — because the world never gave us hits.<br>
          It’s not a comeback tour — because technically, we never went.</p>

        <p>It’s a celebration. Of exile, devotion, satire, and survival. Of stories that had no place until now. Of the
          absent presence of Brogan, wherever he is.</p>

        <p>Each night, I’ll open the suitcase and choose from:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>“Sleep Well Lads”</strong> — a lullaby for lost boys.</li>
          <li><strong>“Rodent in the Lunchbox”</strong> — a spoken-word scandal.</li>
          <li><strong>“The Drunken Paddy Reincarnated”</strong> — the gospel of glorious defiance.</li>
          <li><strong>“The Emigrant’s Regret”</strong> — love lost in the cold streets of Amerikay.</li>
          <li><strong>“Roses and Poitín”</strong> — a waltz for doomed romantics.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>And new songs — written for this tour, from the edge of fifty.</p>

        <p>There’ll be stories. Laughter. Silences you can feel. Maybe even a guest appearance from Rainbow the Donkey
          (if she cooperates).</p>

        <p><strong>📍 Where Are We Going?</strong><br>
          Everywhere we weren’t invited to in the first place:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Rural halls in Mayo, Cork, and Donegal</li>
          <li>Community theatres in Luxembourg, Berlin, and Brussels</li>
          <li>Courtyards in Cape Town and Harare</li>
          <li>A poetry shed in Kilfenora</li>
          <li>And a donkey sanctuary that’s “reviewing our request”</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>💬 Why Now?</strong><br>
          Because I’m nearly fifty.<br>
          Because the songs are ready.<br>
          Because Brogan would never forgive me if I didn’t.</p>

      <h2>Lads, Legends, and Lamentations: The Women of Grogan & Brogan</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 29 May 2025</p>
      <p>Behind every Grogan or Brogan lies a woman with a sharper tongue, a better plan, or at the very least, a bottle
        of poitín labelled “for pain.”</p>
          <img src="assets/rose-and-poitin-small.jpg"
        alt="Grogan and Brogan meet a woman" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;">

      <span id="entry3" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 Lads, Legends, and Lamentations: The Women of Grogan & Brogan</p>

        <p>While Grogan stumbles through misty fields and Brogan loses bets involving donkeys and mushy peas, it’s the
          women in their world who carry the true poetry — fierce, funny, and fearsomely independent.</p>

        <p>Take the red-haired woman at the fair in <em>Roses and Poitín</em>. She marches through Ballymahone like a
          banshee on a mission, lectures the poitín vendor, critiques donkey sculpture, and demolishes Grogan’s
          courtship verse with the line: “Then pray to the Holy Mother you don’t throw up on my shoes.” Iconic.</p>

        <p>Or consider the widow in <em>Handsome Devil</em>, seduced by a fiddler with sad eyes and velvet trousers.
          When he vanishes, it’s not her furniture he’s taken — it’s her heart. Her final line, spoken from her
          deathbed, could silence any room: “I am still looking for the interstice between reality and dream.”</p>

        <p>Then there’s the unnamed woman in <em>The Lonely Washerwoman</em> — a tragic ballad of love, betrayal, and
          terrible domestic timing. She does what Grogan and Brogan often don’t: takes action. It’s misguided, it’s
          awful, and yet it’s deeply human.</p>

        <p>And of course, we have Margaret and Maureen — the indomitable voices of the <em>Epistolary Suite</em>.
          Margaret, the poetic penpal with a flair for fantasy. Maureen, the long-suffering wife with zero patience for
          nonsense and a talent for fire-breathing replies.</p>

        <p>These women aren’t just muses or plot points. They’re the spine and spark of Grogan & Brogan’s ballads —
          complex, contradictory, and unforgettably alive. They outwit, outlast, and often outlove the lads.</p>

        <p>As Brogan once said after being dumped for the third time in a week: “They break your heart, but they improve
          your songs.”</p>

        <p>We raise a glass (and maybe a toffee) to the legends who haunt the verses and walk the boreens — fierce,
          flawed, and always worth singing about.</p>

      <h2>Grogan’s Guide to Living Abroad (Badly)</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 29 May 2025</p>
      <p>Whether you’re dodging rent in Birmingham or composing laments in a Luxembourg hostel, Grogan has thoughts —
        none of them useful.</p>
        <img src="assets/grogan-living-abroad-small.jpg"
        alt="Grogan living abroad" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;">

      <span id="entry4" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 Grogan’s Guide to Living Abroad (Badly)</p>

        <p>If you're Irish and find yourself outside Ireland, odds are you're one missed Ryanair flight away from
          becoming a tragic ballad. Fortunately, Grogan’s here to help. Or confuse. Same thing really.</p>

        <p><strong>Tip #1: Trust No Landlocked Country</strong><br>
          If there’s no sea breeze, there’s no sense. Your bones will dry out. See <em>Boat for Boston</em> or <em>Lost
            at Sea</em> for what happens when you're cut off from salt water and moral direction.</p>

        <p><strong>Tip #2: Your Donkey Will Always Miss You More Than Deirdre</strong><br>
          This is science. Rainbow didn’t judge, cheat, or critique your fiddle playing. If you're abroad and pining,
          make sure it's for the right beast.</p>

        <p><strong>Tip #3: The Phrase “I’m Here for Cultural Exchange” Covers a Multitude of Sins</strong><br>
          Including long stints in Polish hostels, questionable Lisbon poetry readings, and that regrettable poitín
          tasting in a Luxembourg forest.</p>

        <p><strong>Tip #4: Learn the Local Word for “Eejit”</strong><br>
          Because you will hear it. Often. Especially after quoting Yeats at the tax office.</p>

        <p><strong>Tip #5: Poitín + Existential Homesickness = Song</strong><br>
          This is the formula behind <em>The Exile’s Lament</em>, <em>England</em>, and half of your emotional
          breakdowns. Use responsibly.</p>

        <p><strong>Tip #6: Be Wary of Anyone Who Calls You “Well-Integrated”</strong><br>
          It usually means you’ve stopped dancing at bus stops. Reconsider your life choices.</p>

        <p><strong>Tip #7: Remember — Even Abroad, There’s Always Another Grogan Nearby</strong><br>
          Usually slumped over a pint, humming an unfinished verse, wondering how to rhyme “Eurocrat” with “spleen.”
          Introduce yourself.</p>

        <p>In the end, living abroad is less about success and more about survival — emotional, cultural, poetic. If you
          can’t find meaning, at least find a good pub. And if that fails, write a song and pretend it’s deep.</p>

        <p>You may be lost at sea — but by God, you’ll have a chorus.</p>

      <h2>In Praise of the Blessed Pint</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 29 May 2025</p>
      <p>Some say the black stuff is a drink. Grogan & Brogan know better: it’s a vocation, a philosophy, a slightly
        tragic love affair.</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-brogan-stout-small.jpg" alt="Grogan writing poetry while Brogan raises a pint of stout"
        class="story-image" style="max-width: 15%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;">

      <span id="entry7" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 In Praise of the Blessed Pint</p>

        <p>There are men who drink to forget, and men who drink to remember. Grogan and Brogan drink because the pint
          winked first.</p>

        <p>It began, as most things do, in Ballymahone. Grogan had written a lament to a missing sock. Brogan had tried
          to bottle poitín using recycled holy water. Both were banned from the parish newsletter.</p>

        <p>So they wandered — west, then east, then vaguely sideways — until they reached a pub whose name neither can
          recall but whose stout “tasted like forgiveness.”</p>

        <p><strong>What makes Irish stout holy?</strong><br>
          It is black as the souls of bishops. Creamy as a nun’s sigh. It settles, as all things should. It teaches
          patience, penance, and quiet songcraft. It stains your moustache and soul in equal measure.</p>

        <p>Grogan says a proper pint should be poured in silence, observed like an eclipse, and then spoken to gently —
          as one would a haunted fiddle.</p>

        <p>Brogan disagrees. He believes the pint is a mirror. “It shows you what’s inside. That’s why it’s black.”</p>

        <p>Between them, they’ve composed 37 verses on the virtues of stout, including one accidentally recited at a
          cousin’s funeral and another banned by the Galway Tourism Board for “blasphemous agricultural metaphors.”</p>

        <p>Of course, there are rules:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Never toast without eye contact. It may summon banshees.</li>
          <li>Never trust a pint you didn’t see poured. (This applies to priests and pints alike.)</li>
          <li>Never write poetry while drinking stout unless you are prepared to weep or propose marriage to a statue.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>In Luxembourg, the lads tried local brews. “It’s like stout,” said Brogan, “if stout forgot who it was and
          married into a Belgian family.”</p>

        <p>So they returned to their roots. Or at least their stools. Grogan with a notebook full of epiphanies, Brogan
          with a face like rain and two half-verses about foam.</p>

        <p>The pint remains. Steady. Silky. Sly.</p>

        <p>And somewhere in the corner, as the head settles and the silence ripples, Grogan and Brogan raise their
          glasses and toast to the only religion they’ve never abandoned:</p>

        <p><em>The Blessed Pint.</em></p>

      <h2>The Donkey in Irish Traditional Music</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 29 May 2025</p>
      <p>They carried turf, saints, poitín, and prophets. Now they carry meaning — especially in the songs of Grogan &
        Brogan.</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-brogan-donkey-small.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan donkey with wreath, poitín jugs, and turf"
        class="blog-image" style="max-width: 25%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;">


      <span id="entry8" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 The Donkey in Irish Traditional Music — and in the hearts of Grogan & Brogan</p>

        <p>The Irish donkey is more than a beast of burden. She is a muse, a martyr, a mobile metaphor. In folk music,
          she’s often the one character who never complains, even as she hauls seaweed, turf, or Grogan himself back
          from the fair in Ballymahone.</p>

        <p>Historically, the donkey featured as the humble workmate of the peasantry — the rural backbone pulling carts
          through bog and boreen. But in song, she has evolved. In Grogan & Brogan’s universe, she achieves something
          higher: poetic elevation.</p>

        <p>Consider <strong>“Rainbow,”</strong> Grogan’s equine soulmate and emotional anchor. She’s not just a donkey.
          She’s a confidante, a critic, a creature who outlasts the wife, the landlord, and the tax inspector. The
          refrain practically writes itself:</p>

        <p><em>“Your song be abrasive, but for melody I’d have bought a parrot.”</em></p>

        <p>Brogan claims to have once placed a winning bet on a donkey race in Louth. The donkey’s name was “Maud Gonne
          with Teeth.” The payout funded several failed romantic ventures and the first draft of <em>The Book of
            Blarney, Vol. II</em>.</p>

        <p>But the donkey is not merely comic relief. In <strong>“Mental Health in the West of Ireland in
            1968,”</strong> the donkey becomes a conversational partner — wise, silent, non-judging. The priest might
          deliver penance, the doctor prescriptions, but the donkey? She listens.</p>

        <p>It’s no surprise that when Grogan once tried to write a spiritual ballad without mentioning a donkey, his pen
          snapped in half. Brogan declared it divine intervention.</p>

        <p>To summarise: In Irish song, the donkey may seem lowly — but she carries high truths. She endures where
          others falter. She knows where the bones are buried. And in the songs of Grogan & Brogan, she’s every bit as
          important as the bard himself.</p>

        <p>So next time you hear a bray from the back field, don’t ignore it. It might just be the beginning of your
          next chorus.</p>

      <h2>Poitín & Philosophy: The True Spirit of Irish Thought</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 29 May 2025</p>
      <p>Before Socrates had hemlock, Brogan had poitín. Only one of them lived to finish his thoughts — and his pint.
      </p>

      <img src="assets/grogan-poitin-banner-small.jpg" alt="Grogan writing in a notebook, Poitín Philosopher style"
        class="blog-image" style="max-width: 22%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;">


      <span id="entry9" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 Poitín & Philosophy: The True Spirit of Irish Thought</p>

        <p>It’s often said that Ireland’s two great exports are saints and song. But Grogan & Brogan argue there’s a
          third: <strong>epistemological inebriation</strong>, bottled and passed hand to hand since the dawn of turf.
        </p>

        <p>Grogan claims he wrote his finest verse after “consulting the smoky angel.” Brogan once declared: “The Holy
          Spirit is 70% proof and doesn’t like being questioned.” Together, they have forged a sacred school of thought
          known locally as <em>The Lismore Lounge of Speculative Intoxication.</em></p>

        <p>But this is not mere drunkenness. This is <strong>structured confusion</strong> — a long-standing tradition
          in which poitín serves as both *sacrament and solvent* for metaphysical inquiry.</p>

        <p><strong>Key principles of the Poitín School include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reality is bendable — especially after the third glass.</li>
          <li>Truth is like mist: beautiful, elusive, and best observed through the bottom of a jar.</li>
          <li>Every meaningful conversation starts with “I probably shouldn’t be telling you this...”</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In *Roses and Poitín*, Grogan attempts courtship using theological praise and poetic slurring. In *Give the
          Devil His Due*, he reaches moral enlightenment in the form of lyrical compromise. Brogan, meanwhile, once
          hallucinated a donkey quoting Kant. (“Categorical imperative? Get out of my field.”)</p>

        <p>It’s said that when Joyce left Ireland, he took two suitcases: one for clothes and one for smuggled truth.
          Grogan & Brogan would argue you only need the second — and a bottle to go with it.</p>

        <p>So pour a dram, open your third eye (and close your second), and let poitín guide your hand and undo your
          doubt. Just don’t forget what you wrote. Or where you wrote it. Or who you wrote it for.</p>

        <p>As Brogan once muttered, forehead against the bar: <em>“If Descartes had poitín, he would’ve doubted
            quicker.”</em></p>

      <h2>Rural Ireland: A Love Letter in Turf and Absurdity</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 30 May 2025</p>
      <p>It is where time slows, donkeys whisper, and your sins are between you and the priest — unless he’s in the poem
        too.</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-holy-well-small.jpg" alt="Grogan writing beside a rural holy well marked 'Tobar Naofa'"
        class="blog-image" style="max-width: 25%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;">


      <span id="entry10" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 Rural Ireland: A Love Letter in Turf and Absurdity</p>

        <p>For Grogan & Brogan, rural Ireland isn’t a place — it’s a condition. A metaphysical peat bog where
          melancholy, magic, and mischief grow side by side. Where the rosary shares shelf space with a jar of poitín
          and the donkey knows more than the bishop.</p>

        <p>Grogan calls it “The birthplace of longing.” Brogan calls it “the only place you can be broke, drunk, poetic
          and still invited to dinner.”</p>

        <p>From <strong>Fishing Boats at Sea</strong>:</p>
        <p><em>“In their beds, the emptiness of the starched clean sheets,
            Recalls the shapes that once to this house did keep…”</em></p>

        <p>Here, silence speaks louder than sermon, and the land remembers. The characters of Grogan & Brogan’s ballads
          may wander far — to Birmingham, Boston or perdition — but their thoughts always stray homeward, to the bog,
          the boreen, the barrel of rain.</p>

        <p>In <strong>Rainbow</strong>, a man’s deepest connection isn’t to his departed wife or estranged kin — but to
          his donkey:</p>
        <p><em>“Dear God in heaven, may the donkeys be blessed,
            They’ve toiled in the fields and ever gave of their best…”</em></p>

        <p>Rural Ireland is where saints are sarcastic and prophets wear gumboots. In <strong>Mental Health in the West
            of Ireland</strong>, the narrator’s only stable companion is a donkey named Rainbow — with whom he shares
          his diagnosis, his doubts, and likely his lunch.</p>

        <p><em>“Sir, do I write in pencil or in pen?”
            “Here’s a pair of scissors, cut a hole in your finger and write it out in blood.”</em></p>

        <p>And in <strong>The Exile’s Lament</strong>, the land itself is a lost lover, remembered in dreams more
          vividly than any city street:</p>
        <p><em>“They all revolve around the valleys fair and green,
            Fairer than any maiden I have ever seen…”</em></p>

        <p>For Grogan & Brogan, rural Ireland is not perfect. It’s tough, harsh, rain-soaked and ecclesiastically
          confusing. But it’s home. It’s the muse. It’s the thing worth singing about — again and again, until the turf
          runs out and the bottle’s dry.</p>

        <p>And that’s why they keep writing.</p>

      <h2>Fishing the Irish Sea: Salt, Song & Survival</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 30 May 2025</p>
      <p>It’s not just work. It’s myth. It’s mourning. It’s where Grogan & Brogan cast their lines into history — and
        hauled back verses.</p>

      <img src="assets/grogan-fishing-blog-small.jpg"
        alt="Grogan writing on a rocky Irish shore at dawn, with a fishing boat in the background" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 15%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;">


      <span id="entry11" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 Fishing the Irish Sea: Salt, Song & Survival</p>

        <p>Fishing has always been more than industry in Irish life. It’s a spiritual act. A wager. A song waiting to
          happen. For Grogan & Brogan, the sea is a stage where tragedy, communion, and the occasional ghost all take
          their bow.</p>

        <p>In <strong>Fishing Boats at Sea</strong>, the nets are full of more than herring. The boats return — but not
          all the men do:</p>
        <p><em>“Upon the wall, are the pictures of those who did not return,
            From the ocean, whose nets and gear were spurned…”</em></p>

        <p>The sea in these songs is both cruel and consoling — a paradox as Irish as a pint in the rain. In
          <strong>Lost at Sea</strong>, the fisherman pleads with his mother — and the elements — for safe return. It’s
          a ballad of aching devotion, weather-beaten fear, and Atlantic resolve.
        </p>

        <p><em>“There was a strange electric smell in the air,
            And the seagulls were wheeling as our nets we did repair.”</em></p>

        <p>Back on land, <strong>Lament of the Fisherman’s Wife</strong> gives voice to those left behind. A litany of
          rising tension, debt, calving cows, whiskey guilt, and the hard reality that the sea provides — but it also
          takes.</p>

        <p><em>“Get out of bed ye,
            The ocean’s waiting to provide,
            Though it swallowed our brothers,
            In it our hopes we must confide.”</em></p>

        <p>And then there’s Grogan himself, whose poems smell of brine and whose lyrics read like messages found in
          bottles washed ashore. Brogan, meanwhile, swears he once dated a mermaid near Ballycotton. (No witnesses.)</p>

        <p>Fishing, for Grogan & Brogan, is not just about food or trade. It’s about memory, longing, and the unending
          Irish dialogue with the sea. A song line tossed like a net. A silence deep as the tide. And always — always —
          the hope that the boat returns.</p>

      <h2>Gaeilge: Teanga na Fola, na Filíochta, agus na Fadhbanna</h2>
      <p class="date">Foilsithe ar 30 Bealtaine 2025</p>
      <p>Is í an Ghaeilge croítheanga G&B — fiú nuair nach dtuigeann siad a chéile, tuigtear an rud is tábhachtaí.</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-as-gaeilge-small.jpg"
        alt="Grogan holding a pocket Irish-English dictionary beside a Gaeltacht signpost" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 15%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;">


      <span id="entry12" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 Gaeilge: Teanga na Fola, na Filíochta, agus na Fadhbanna</p>

        <p>Is minic a chloistear Grogan ag rá: “Tá mo chroí i nGaeilge, ach tá mo inchinn fós ag aistriú.” Agus Brogan?
          “Is breá liom Gaeilge — ach is fuath léi mé.”</p>

        <p>I bhfírinne, tá caidreamh G&B leis an Ghaeilge cosúil lena gcaidreamh le poitín: <strong>beagán de mhagadh,
            beagán de mhistéir, agus an iomarca de bhrí.</strong></p>

        <p>Is léir an Ghaeilge sna hamhráin mar <em>Dying Tongues</em> agus <em>Letter from Donegal Airport</em>, ina
          gcailltear duine i n-aerfort iargúlta de bharr míthuiscint teanga. Ach tá sé greannmhar freisin:</p>

        <p><em>“Dúirt sí 'Fan ansin,' agus shíl mé gur ainm an bhaile é…”</em></p>

        <p>Bhí iarracht ag Grogan uair amháin sean-nós a chanadh i gCorca Dhuibhne, ach d’fhág sé leis an línte seo:</p>
        <p><em>“Ó mo chroí, níl a fhios agam an briathar don téarma sin — ach tá sé brónach go leor mar atá.”</em></p>

        <p>Dóibh, is bealach í an Ghaeilge chun an stair a mhothú, na máithreacha a chloisteáil arís, agus rudaí a rá
          nach féidir i mBéarla gan casacht nó caint faoi aimsir na Peig.</p>

        <p>Ag deireadh an lae, is breá le G&B an Ghaeilge, fiú má dhéanann sí crá orthu. Agus is é sin a dhéanann an grá
          fíor — buan, deacair, ach lán le ceol.</p>

        <p><em>“Is minic a thuig an t-éan an fhilíocht nár thuig an fear — ach bhí sé á chanadh ar aon nós.”</em></p>

      <h2>“Un Verre de Poitín, s’il vous plaît”: Grogan & Brogan, French, and the Art of Exile</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 30 May 2025</p>
      <p>Grogan & Brogan speak French like they speak truth — awkwardly, poetically, and usually after one too many.</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-in-luxembourg-small.jpg"
        alt="Grogan walking and writing in the winding lanes of Luxembourg" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;">


      <span id="entry13" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 “Un Verre de Poitín, s’il vous plaît”: G&B, French, and the Art of Exile</p>

        <p>For Grogan & Brogan, French is less a language than a *mood*. A vague perfume of melancholy and mischief that
          drifts into their songs whenever the Liffey seems too narrow for their European dreams.</p>

        <p>Living in Luxembourg — surrounded by bureaucrats, bankers, and baguettes — they found themselves uttering
          phrases like “non remboursable” and “l’identité européenne” with increasing regularity. And as always, the
          songs followed.</p>

        <p>In <strong>La Mariée de Portbou</strong>, Grogan reaches for French to approach a story too sad for English.
          The rhythm of the lines reflects the language’s elegance, even as the theme remains tragic:</p>
        <p><em>“Tu étais couchée,
            Sous les fleurs blanches de la mer…”</em></p>

        <p>Meanwhile, in <strong>The Drunken Paddy Reincarnated</strong>, Brogan waxes philosophical about Irishness
          abroad, calling himself “le dernier poète de la buvette.” He claims Joyce came to him in a dream, quoting
          Foucault in a Westmeath accent.</p>

        <p>And in <strong>The Irish Winnie the Pooh</strong>, we hear the surreal collision of Gaelic soul and Gallic
          flourish:</p>
        <p><em>“Mon dieu, said the donkey,
            Where is the honey of my youth?”</em></p>

        <p>For G&B, French offers *distance* — from home, from heartbreak, from the stiff collars of Irish tradition.
          It’s a poetic passport that allows them to drift through memory and myth without declaring customs.</p>

        <p>They still don’t speak French very well. But they sing it with feeling. And sometimes that’s more than
          enough.</p>

        <p>As Brogan once told a Luxembourg waiter who corrected his accent:
          <em>“Ah non, monsieur. I’m not trying to speak French. I’m trying to feel it.”</em>
        </p>

      <h2>Grogan & Brogan sprechen Deutsch?</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 31 May 2025</p>
      <p>How did two Irish-rooted lads end up crooning in German? Sit tight...</p>
   
        <img src="assets/grogan-berlin-small.jpg" alt="Grogan reading Rilke with a pint and a sheep in Berlin" class="blog-image" style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />



      <span id="entry14" style="display:none;">

        <p>🎶 <em>Grogan & Brogan sprechen Deutsch?</em></p>

        <p>It began — as many G&B adventures do — in a Luxembourgish bus shelter during a thunderstorm. Brogan was
          attempting to translate the chorus of *Whiskey in the Jar* into Hochdeutsch. Grogan was trying to remember the
          dative case while holding a dripping bodhrán. Someone shouted "Dat ass kee Reen, dat ass eng Apokalips!" and
          the rest, as they say, is history.</p>

        <p>But the truth runs deeper.</p>

        <p>Grogan (that’s me) has long harboured a linguistic itch. Raised on Irish rebel songs and Rainier Maria Rilke
          (blame the nuns), I fell in love with the angular poetics of the German tongue. There’s something in the way
          it holds a phrase — like a stone in the mouth — that reminds me of old Irish.</p>

        <p>Brogan was less enthusiastic. “German,” he once declared, “is like a cupboard full of consonants falling down
          the stairs.” But even he admitted, over a Spätzle-laced supper, that certain German words — *Sehnsucht*,
          *Heimat*, *Vergänglichkeit* — carried the same ache as a good Irish lament.</p>

        <p>So we began to experiment. Not out of pretension, but out of curiosity. What would it mean to sing an Irish
          song in German? Would it become a parody, a prayer, a punchline?</p>

        <p>Turns out — all three.</p>

        <p>We now have songs where the verses swing in English and the choruses lurch into German. Others where Grogan
          recites a poetic curse in Goethe’s tongue while Brogan hums *The Rocky Road to Dublin* underneath. We've
          written one about a grandfather in Namibia (*Großvater Herero*) and another that just repeats “Bratkartoffeln”
          to the rhythm of *Óró Sé do Bheatha ‘Bhaile*.</p>

        <p>Why?</p>

        <p>Because the Irish soul doesn’t stop at Shannon Airport. And sometimes, when you’ve been away from home long
          enough, German sounds more Irish than English ever could.</p>

        <p>It’s in the longing. The exile. The strange, stubborn beauty.</p>

        <p>And yes — sometimes it’s just because the word *Schmetterling* makes Brogan giggle like a six-year-old with a
          tin whistle.</p>

        <p>We’re not trying to be clever. We’re trying to be honest. About how messy and marvellous language can be when
          you’ve got too many homes, too many hearts, and not enough syllables to go round.</p>

        <p>If you ever hear an accordion wheeze out a line of Brecht in a Cork accent — that’s probably us.</p>

        <p>Danke und slán,</p>

        <p><strong>Grogan (und ein bisschen Brogan)</strong></p>

  <h2>Grogan & Brogan in Namibia</h2>
  <p class="date">Posted on 31 May 2025</p>
  <p>What are two Irish lads doing writing songs about Namibia? It's not what you think...</p>
  <img src="assets/grogan_brogan_namibia_web_optimized_800x800.webp" alt="Grogan in Namibia" class="blog-image" style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

  <span id="entry15" style="display:none;">

    <p>🌍 <em>“It’s a long way from Ballymahone to Lüderitz.”</em></p>

    <p>That’s what Brogan said the first time we stood on the red earth near Shark Island — looking out at a cruel Atlantic that had carried so many Irish out, and so many others in.</p>

    <p>Namibia isn’t a place you expect to find in an Irish folk song. But for us, it was inevitable.</p>

    <p>You see, Grogan’s grandfather — the mysterious “Großvater Herero” — served under a German flag in the colonial South West Africa campaigns. The details are muddy. Some say he deserted. Some say he joined the Nama resistance. All we know for certain is that he returned with a battered accordion and a hatred of uniforms.</p>

    <p>Our song <strong><em>Großvater Herero</em></strong> is part family myth, part confession. It tells of guilt passed down like a tarnished heirloom. Of desert silence that never forgets. It’s a song where German mixes with Afrikaans, and history refuses to stay buried.</p>

    <p>Another piece, <strong><em>Shark Island Lament</em></strong>, follows the windblown ghosts of that concentration camp near Lüderitz — a song written for those whose names are not in the museums, but in the sand. The Irish in us saw it and knew it: colonisation doesn’t change its clothes, just its accent.</p>

    <p>Namibia showed us what happens when maps are drawn in blood and sand. And it made us wonder: where else has Ireland left its footprints, even where it never meant to?</p>

    <p>So yes — Namibia. A place of endless sky, and bottomless grief. But also of song. And sometimes that’s all we have to offer — a song, an old accordion, a memory passed down like a wound that sings.</p>

    <p>If you ever hear a G&B tune with a desert drone and a Berlin echo, now you know why.</p>

    <p>With dust in our boots and guilt in our harmonies,</p>

    <p><strong>Grogan & Brogan</strong></p>

  <h2>Grogan & Brogan’s Worst Gig</h2>
  <p class="date">Posted on 31 May 2025</p>
  <p>You think you've had a bad night? Try this on for size…</p>
  <img src="assets/grogan-worst-gig-with-brogan-small.jpg" alt="Grogan's Worst Gig" class="blog-image" style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

  <span id="entry5" style="display:none;">

    <p>🎤 <em>“The soundman was drunk, the mic was dead, and the only person clapping was a dog.”</em></p>

    <p>That, in a nutshell, was <strong>Grogan & Brogan’s worst gig</strong>. But it started, as these things do, with misplaced hope and a dodgy promise.</p>

    <p>We were booked to play at what was billed as the “Kilcar Cultural Weekender.” The poster had a harp, a pint, and what appeared to be the ghost of Patrick Kavanagh photoshopped into a kayak. We should have known.</p>

    <p>The venue turned out to be the back room of a chipper, directly adjacent to the fryer. Half the crowd were there for battered sausages. The other half were the staff.</p>

    <p>Brogan had tuned his bouzouki to open C# minor for dramatic effect. Grogan opened with a heartfelt rendition of <em>“Lament for a Lost Librarian.”</em> The silence that followed could have cured insomnia.</p>

    <p>Things got worse. The organiser vanished halfway through. The “lighting technician” was a teenager with a vape and a torch. Midway through our third number, a fight broke out near the condiment counter — allegedly over who invented curry chips.</p>

    <p>The final straw? A child climbed onto the “stage” and screamed: <strong>“YOU’RE NOT EVEN ON SPOTIFY!”</strong></p>

    <p>He was right. We weren’t. We still aren’t.</p>

    <p>We finished our set with the dignity of monks on fire and collected our fee: two cans of Club Orange and a voucher for garlic mushrooms (expired). Brogan wept silently into his accordion case. Grogan took a vow never to perform again in any venue where coleslaw is served by the litre.</p>

    <p>So yes, that was the worst gig.</p>

    <p>But the thing is — we still wrote a song about it. And the dog did clap. With its tail. And sometimes, that’s enough.</p>

    <p>Never again, Kilcar. Unless the cheque clears.</p>

  <h2>Grogan, Memory & the Madness of History</h2>
  <p class="date">Posted on 31 May 2025</p>
  <p>He’s a man of many tunes and a memory like a museum. But what exactly is Grogan's relationship with history?</p>
  <img src="assets/grogan-history-small.jpg" alt="Grogan looking into the past" class="blog-image" style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

  <span id="entry16" style="display:none;">

    <p>🕯 <em>“History isn’t a story, it’s a haunting.”</em> — Grogan, to Brogan, somewhere between Doolin and Dún Laoghaire.</p>

    <p>Grogan has always been fascinated by the past — not in the way of academics or archivists, but like a man who's convinced the dead are still whispering. Whether in a famine field, an abandoned convent, or a pub that remembers the Tan War better than its drink prices, Grogan listens.</p>

    <p>And the past speaks to him. In songs.</p>

    <p>Take <strong><em>The Exile’s Lament</em></strong>: a song that blurs the sorrow of one man’s forced departure from Ireland with the wider grief of a nation broken by emigration. Or <strong><em>Großvater Herero</em></strong>, which traces a familial thread back to colonial Namibia and unearths not just ancestry, but atrocity.</p>

    <p>There’s reverence in these songs — for loss, for dignity, for complexity. But there’s also a slyness. Grogan never lets sentimentality rot the roots. Songs like <strong><em>Paddy Macaroni</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Bard of Ballymahone</em></strong> poke fun at Ireland’s obsession with its own myths, even while participating in them.</p>

    <p>Brogan once said: <em>“Grogan respects history the way a cat respects furniture — it’s sacred, but still gets clawed.”</em></p>

    <p>That’s true. In <strong><em>Shark Island Lament</em></strong>, we hear Grogan's reverence in the way he channels the voice of the dead — but his rage seeps through in the very choice to sing about something so many have forgotten.</p>

    <p>In other songs — like <strong><em>The Poet of Old</em></strong> — Grogan takes history personally. It’s not some distant tapestry. It’s a coat he wears, even if it’s itchy. Memory is not a luxury. It’s the price of being awake.</p>

    <p>And so, in every verse, he reanimates the past. Not as nostalgia — but as resistance.</p>

    <p>In the G&B universe, history is not a thing that happened. It’s a ghost that still sings. And Grogan, despite his cranky scepticism, remains its unlikely cantor — braying, ballading, bellowing… for all the voices that never got to.</p>

    <p>🧠 <em>“I talk to my donkey. The donkey doesn’t answer. And somehow that helps.”</em> — Grogan</p>

    <p>For all the laughs, the wigs, the wild gigs and wandering, Grogan & Brogan have never shied away from the shadows. If anything, they walk beside them — quietly, stubbornly, like men who know the road is long and often lonely.</p>

    <p>In songs like <strong><em>Mental Health in the West of Ireland (1968)</em></strong>, we hear it clearly: a world where men talk to animals because there’s no one else to talk to. Where emotional pain is wrapped in silence, or smothered under a layer of turf smoke and sarcasm.</p>

    <p>Grogan has never claimed to have answers. But he has songs. And sometimes that’s the first light in the bog.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Without You</em></strong> offers another take — a raw, almost prayer-like appeal to love as the thread that holds us together. Not romantic love. But the kind that keeps you going when your own mind tries to leave you behind.</p>

    <p>There’s humour too — because there has to be. <strong><em>The Mad Priest of Ballynahinch</em></strong> might raise eyebrows, but it’s also a portrait of someone unravelled by guilt, faith, and the quiet violence of isolation.</p>

    <p>Brogan puts it simply: <em>“We write these songs because we needed them ourselves first.”</em></p>

    <p>And maybe that’s the point. Not to fix it. Not to tidy it. But to say it. To sing it. To give the sadness a tune, so it has somewhere to go.</p>

    <p>If you’ve ever stared at the sea too long, or felt too tired to explain the storm in your chest, know this: Grogan’s probably already written it down. And Brogan’s somewhere behind him, tuning the bouzouki.</p>

  <h2>Grogan & Aleksandr Blok: A Strange Devotion</h2>
  <p class="date">Posted on 31 May 2025</p>
  <p>You wouldn’t think an Irishman would find a kindred soul in a dead Russian Symbolist. But then again, you haven’t met Grogan.</p>
  <img src="assets/grogan-and-blok-alt-small.jpg" alt="Grogan and Aleksandr Blok" class="blog-image" style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

  <span id="entry8" style="display:none;">

    <p>📖 <em>“I do not love the living — only the dead who still speak.”</em> — Grogan, quoting Blok to a startled Latvian customs officer</p>

    <p>There are obsessions. And then there’s Grogan’s relationship with the Russian poet Aleksandr Blok (1880–1921).</p>

    <p>It began in St. Petersburg, 1998. Grogan was meant to be teaching English. Instead, he found himself in a crumbling stairwell, clutching a samizdat copy of <em>The Twelve</em> and wondering why every Russian seemed to walk with their soul outside their body.</p>

    <p>Blok’s poetry — mystical, doomed, aching with history — hit him like a communion chalice to the back of the head. Grogan, already susceptible to ghostly voices and metaphysical rain, was hooked.</p>

    <p>In Blok, he found a brother in lyric exile: someone who worshipped beauty but also feared it. Someone who loved the past so much it nearly killed him.</p>

    <p>This devotion appears — sideways — in several G&B songs. <strong><em>Voice of the Mystic Homeland</em></strong> owes its cadence to Blok’s symbolist rhythms. <strong><em>Without You</em></strong> carries the same tremble between longing and ruin. Even <strong><em>La Mariée de Portbou</em></strong>, though in French, is soaked in that Blokian atmosphere — where trains disappear, women become apparitions, and time itself unravels into snow.</p>

    <p>Brogan tolerates this fixation with the good humour of a man who once caught Grogan whispering “O mysterious Lady” into a glass of kvass.</p>

    <p>But it runs deep. Blok gave Grogan permission — not to be Russian — but to be haunted. To carry the weight of culture without needing to explain it. To write songs that ache not with memory, but with the <em>absence</em> of memory.</p>

    <p>As Grogan put it: <em>“I don’t understand Blok. That’s why I love him.”</em></p>

    <p>And somewhere in a snowy alley of Petrograd, a ghost smiles through his pince-nez.</p>

  <h2>Grogan on Childhood Memories</h2>
  <p class="date">Posted on 31 May 2025</p>
  <p>Not all memories are golden. Some are turf-smoked, others half-sour. And some wear short trousers and never quite leave...</p>
  <img src="assets/grogan-childhood-small.jpg" alt="Grogan on Childhood Memories" class="blog-image" style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

  <span id="entry19" style="display:none;">

    <p>🪀 <em>“The past is a goat in the living room. You can ignore it, but it will still eat your curtains.”</em> — Grogan</p>

    <p>Grogan doesn’t talk much about childhood — unless he’s had poitín. Or heard the sound of a football against a gable wall. Or caught the faint smell of wet linoleum and boiled ham. Then the veil lifts.</p>

    <p>There are glimpses in his songs. <strong><em>Your Father is Dead</em></strong> is a knife of a memory, drawn from a real-life cruelty that left its mark in lowercase letters. It’s not sentimental — it’s surgical. And true.</p>

    <p><strong><em>The Artist</em></strong> reaches back too — to a boy who saw the world differently and got smacked for it. Who drew saints in biro and was told not to be soft. Who wanted a pencil, and got a rake.</p>

    <p>For Grogan, memory isn’t a scrapbook. It’s a battleground. Some of it tender. Some of it unbearable. And yet — he never discards it. He shapes it into songs. He turns it, like turf, until it’s dry enough to burn.</p>

    <p>Even the comic ones, like <strong><em>Mental Health in the West of Ireland (1968)</em></strong>, are filled with echoes of boyhood misunderstanding — listening in on adult sadness without the language to name it.</p>

    <p>Brogan once found Grogan staring at a cracked toy fire engine and asked if he was alright. Grogan replied: <em>“I’m grand. Just remembering what it’s like to be five and already broken-hearted.”</em></p>

    <p>He writes it down. He sings it. And somewhere in the song, the goat in the living room settles down. For a while.</p>

  <h2>Grogan & Brogan on the Islands of Ireland</h2>
  <p class="date">Posted on 31 May 2025</p>
  <p>Not every exile crosses an ocean. Some only drift a few miles west — and never return.</p>
  <img src="assets/grogan-islands-small.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan on the Islands of Ireland" class="blog-image" style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

  <span id="entry20" style="display:none;">

    <p>⛴️ <em>“The sea isn’t water. It’s silence with weather.”</em> — Grogan, watching the Arranmore ferry vanish in fog</p>

    <p>Grogan has always had a thing for islands. Not just the obvious kind — the Inishbofins, Torys, and Valentias — but the emotional ones. The psychic rock outcroppings where old people tell stories to the wind and children leave without saying goodbye.</p>

    <p>He wrote <strong><em>Lost at Sea</em></strong> after staring out at Skellig Michael for too long. He claims the island hummed back at him. Brogan thinks it was just hunger. Either way, the song speaks of those left behind — and those who never came home.</p>

    <p>There’s something about islands in Irish consciousness. We project things onto them. Saints. Ghosts. Old lovers. Wild goats. Grogan once spent a week on Clare Island talking to a stone circle and came back with three verses and a sunburn.</p>

    <p>In <strong><em>Fishing Boats at Sea</em></strong>, Grogan’s islands become metaphors for men — unreachable, rugged, watching the world from afar. In <strong><em>The Emigrant’s Regret</em></strong>, the island is home: a dot in the Atlantic that haunts the emigrant’s dreams like a prayer they forgot how to say.</p>

    <p>Brogan, as usual, is more practical: <em>“An island’s grand if you’ve a boat. Or a pub.”</em></p>

    <p>But for Grogan, the islands are poems without stanzas. They don't need to rhyme. They just need to be. Remote. Wounded. Defiant.</p>

    <p>We all carry a few islands inside us. Some with music. Some with silence. Some we’ll never visit again — except in song.</p>

  <h2>Grogan & Brogan and the Butterflies of Ireland</h2>
  <p class="date">Posted on 31 May 2025</p>
  <p>They say butterflies don’t belong in Irish weather. But like poems, grief, and divilment — they come anyway.</p>
  <img src="assets/grogan-butterflies-small.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan and the Butterflies of Ireland" class="blog-image" style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

  <span id="entry21" style="display:none;">

    <p>🦋 <em>“A butterfly is just a ghost with better timing.”</em> — Grogan</p>

    <p>Grogan has long held a quiet obsession with Irish butterflies. Not in a collector’s way — he doesn’t pin or label. He watches. He notes. He listens.</p>

    <p>There’s a sense in his songs that butterflies are not insects, but messages. From where? From whom? He never says. But in <strong><em>Voice of the Mystic Homeland</em></strong>, one drifts through the final verse like a spirit choosing not to stay. In <strong><em>Rainbow</em></strong>, a butterfly appears beside the donkey — both mysterious, both holy in their own stubborn way.</p>

    <p>Brogan calls them “fluttering lies from the hedge.” But even he paused once when a Painted Lady landed on his guitar string and stayed for a full verse.</p>

    <p>In Irish folklore, butterflies can be the souls of the dead. In G&B mythology, they’re part of a deeper world — not symbolic, but actual. They don’t represent freedom. They are freedom. Fleeting, lovely, impossible to follow without losing yourself.</p>

    <p>Grogan once chased a Green Hairstreak across the Burren and lost track of time for three hours. He returned with a sunburn, a half-written stanza, and a wild look in his eyes. “She was teaching me a new scale,” he said.</p>

    <p>And so they keep appearing. In lyrics. In gardens. In graveyards. On stage once, during <strong><em>Fishing Boats at Sea</em></strong>, a Red Admiral landed on Grogan’s notebook. He closed it gently. The song ended early that night.</p>

    <p>Sometimes you follow the butterfly. Sometimes it follows you.</p>
