      <h2>How I Met Brogan</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 29 May 2025</p>
      <p>Memories of Brogan...</p>

        alt="Grogan and Brogan meet in a translation booth with guitar and notebook" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;">

      <span id="entry1" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 How I Met Brogan by Grogan</p>

        <p>I first met Brogan in a translation booth in Luxembourg. Yes — you read that right. Not at a pub session, not
          on a windswept Kerry road, not in the cell of a revolutionary monastery — but in a sterile European Union
          conference room where they were arguing about pig subsidies in seventeen languages.</p>
        <p>He leaned into his microphone and whispered, “This place needs a bodhrán.”</p>
        <p>I didn’t laugh. I wrote it down. That was the first line of the first song we ever wrote together. It was
          never released. We called it <em>“Ballad of the Bureaucrat’s Pig.”</em></p>
        <p>Brogan believed poetry belonged in places that didn’t want it. On roundabouts. In footnotes. In the gaps
          between tired words and missed chances. I think that’s why we got along.</p>
        <p>We came from opposite ends of the same bog:<br>
          He — musical instinct incarnate. A man who could coax melody from a radiator pipe and claimed his earliest
          influence was the sound of rain on a caravan roof.<br>
          Me — a compulsive scribbler. Raised on mass cards and protest songs, obsessed with rhyme, meter, myth, and
          mistakes.</p>
        <p>Together, we wrote. Songs about emigrants and eccentrics. Donkeys and industrial schoolboys. Priests who saw
          visions and women who saw through us. Some songs made people laugh. Some made them weep. A few did both in the
          same verse.</p>

        <p>We bickered, of course. He liked first takes. I liked revisions. He believed in chaos; I believed in
          craftsmanship. But the music found a way through. Always.</p>

        <p>Then one day, he disappeared.</p>

        <p>Not like in a dramatic movie. No farewell note. No tragic accident. Just... gone. His fiddle left behind. His
          boots still muddy. A cupboard full of scribbled half-verses and jars of pickled beets he insisted were good
          for “melodic tone.”</p>

        <p>For a while, I thought he’d faked his own death for publicity. Then I thought he’d gone feral and was living
          off-grid in Donegal, collaborating with seals. I still think that might be true.</p>

        <p>In the years since, I’ve kept writing. But the songs come differently now. Slower. More haunted. Like they’re
          trying to tell me something he forgot to say.</p>

        <p>Recently, I opened the old suitcase where we kept our lyrics — the Grogan & Brogan Songwriting Stash. Dozens
          of them. Some complete, some half-born, others written in languages neither of us spoke.</p>

        <p>And I thought: I can’t let this vanish.</p>

        <p>I’m nearly fifty. Too old for delusions, too young to give up. I want to publish the songs. Record them. Tour
          them across Ireland, Europe, and Africa — every place we ever dreamed aloud. Not for fame. Not even for
          closure.</p>

        <p>For Brogan.</p>

        <p>For the boy who opened his lunchbox to find a rodent and inspired a ballad.</p>

        <p>For the girl who heard <em>“Roses and Poitín”</em> and laughed through her tears.</p>

        <p>For Rainbow the donkey, who brayed on key.</p>

        <p>For the songs that keep arriving, unbidden and beautiful, like drunken angels.</p>

        <p>If you see Brogan — tell him the music’s waiting.</p>

        <p>Tell him I kept his boots.</p>

        <p>And tell him the gigs are starting soon.</p>

    <section class="blog-entry blog-post" data-category="music">
      <h2>Songs from the Stash — The Tour Begins</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on May 29, 2025</p>
      <p><em>“Somewhere in a suitcase under my stairs, Brogan’s spirit was waiting.”</em> I never meant to go back on
        the road...</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-brogan-tour-begins-small-regenerated.jpg"
        alt="Grogan and Brogan meet in a translation booth with guitar and notebook" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;">

      <span id="entry2" style="display:none;">

        <p>But something started stirring this year — a sense that time was no longer patient. That the songs Brogan and
          I wrote — scribbled on receipts, beer mats, and prayer cards — weren’t just memories. They were blueprints.
          Prophecies. Ghosts.</p>

        <p>So I opened the suitcase.</p>

        <p>Inside?<br>
          The Grogan & Brogan stash.</p>

        <p>Forty-seven songs we never released.<br>
          Twelve we only ever sang to donkeys.<br>
          Five written during a blackout in Ballymahone.<br>
          And one we swore we’d only perform “if the world started falling apart.”</p>

        <p><strong>Well… here we are.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>🎶 What Is Songs from the Stash?</strong><br>
          It’s not a greatest hits tour — because the world never gave us hits.<br>
          It’s not a comeback tour — because technically, we never went.</p>

        <p>It’s a celebration. Of exile, devotion, satire, and survival. Of stories that had no place until now. Of the
          absent presence of Brogan, wherever he is.</p>

        <p>Each night, I’ll open the suitcase and choose from:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>“Sleep Well Lads”</strong> — a lullaby for lost boys.</li>
          <li><strong>“Rodent in the Lunchbox”</strong> — a spoken-word scandal.</li>
          <li><strong>“The Drunken Paddy Reincarnated”</strong> — the gospel of glorious defiance.</li>
          <li><strong>“The Emigrant’s Regret”</strong> — love lost in the cold streets of Amerikay.</li>
          <li><strong>“Roses and Poitín”</strong> — a waltz for doomed romantics.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>And new songs — written for this tour, from the edge of fifty.</p>

        <p>There’ll be stories. Laughter. Silences you can feel. Maybe even a guest appearance from Rainbow the Donkey
          (if she cooperates).</p>

        <p><strong>📍 Where Are We Going?</strong><br>
          Everywhere we weren’t invited to in the first place:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Rural halls in Mayo, Cork, and Donegal</li>
          <li>Community theatres in Luxembourg, Berlin, and Brussels</li>
          <li>Courtyards in Cape Town and Harare</li>
          <li>A poetry shed in Kilfenora</li>
          <li>And a donkey sanctuary that’s “reviewing our request”</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>💬 Why Now?</strong><br>
          Because I’m nearly fifty.<br>
          Because the songs are ready.<br>
          Because Brogan would never forgive me if I didn’t.</p>

      <h2>Lads, Legends, and Lamentations: The Women of Grogan & Brogan</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 29 May 2025</p>
      <p>Behind every Grogan or Brogan lies a woman with a sharper tongue, a better plan, or at the very least, a bottle
        of poitín labelled “for pain.”</p>
      <img src="assets/rose-and-poitin-small.jpg" alt="Grogan and Brogan meet a woman" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;">

      <span id="entry3" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 Lads, Legends, and Lamentations: The Women of Grogan & Brogan</p>

        <p>While Grogan stumbles through misty fields and Brogan loses bets involving donkeys and mushy peas, it’s the
          women in their world who carry the true poetry — fierce, funny, and fearsomely independent.</p>

        <p>Take the red-haired woman at the fair in <em>Roses and Poitín</em>. She marches through Ballymahone like a
          banshee on a mission, lectures the poitín vendor, critiques donkey sculpture, and demolishes Grogan’s
          courtship verse with the line: “Then pray to the Holy Mother you don’t throw up on my shoes.” Iconic.</p>

        <p>Or consider the widow in <em>Handsome Devil</em>, seduced by a fiddler with sad eyes and velvet trousers.
          When he vanishes, it’s not her furniture he’s taken — it’s her heart. Her final line, spoken from her
          deathbed, could silence any room: “I am still looking for the interstice between reality and dream.”</p>

        <p>Then there’s the unnamed woman in <em>The Lonely Washerwoman</em> — a tragic ballad of love, betrayal, and
          terrible domestic timing. She does what Grogan and Brogan often don’t: takes action. It’s misguided, it’s
          awful, and yet it’s deeply human.</p>

        <p>And of course, we have Margaret and Maureen — the indomitable voices of the <em>Epistolary Suite</em>.
          Margaret, the poetic penpal with a flair for fantasy. Maureen, the long-suffering wife with zero patience for
          nonsense and a talent for fire-breathing replies.</p>

        <p>These women aren’t just muses or plot points. They’re the spine and spark of Grogan & Brogan’s ballads —
          complex, contradictory, and unforgettably alive. They outwit, outlast, and often outlove the lads.</p>

        <p>As Brogan once said after being dumped for the third time in a week: “They break your heart, but they improve
          your songs.”</p>

        <p>We raise a glass (and maybe a toffee) to the legends who haunt the verses and walk the boreens — fierce,
          flawed, and always worth singing about.</p>

    <section class="blog-entry blog-post" data-category="life">
      <h2>Grogan’s Guide to Living Abroad (Badly)</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 29 May 2025</p>
      <p>Whether you’re dodging rent in Birmingham or composing laments in a Luxembourg hostel, Grogan has thoughts —
        none of them useful.</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-living-abroad-small.jpg" alt="Grogan living abroad" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;">

      <span id="entry4" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 Grogan’s Guide to Living Abroad (Badly)</p>

        <p>If you're Irish and find yourself outside Ireland, odds are you're one missed Ryanair flight away from
          becoming a tragic ballad. Fortunately, Grogan’s here to help. Or confuse. Same thing really.</p>

        <p><strong>Tip #1: Trust No Landlocked Country</strong><br>
          If there’s no sea breeze, there’s no sense. Your bones will dry out. See <em>Boat for Boston</em> or <em>Lost
            at Sea</em> for what happens when you're cut off from salt water and moral direction.</p>

        <p><strong>Tip #2: Your Donkey Will Always Miss You More Than Deirdre</strong><br>
          This is science. Rainbow didn’t judge, cheat, or critique your fiddle playing. If you're abroad and pining,
          make sure it's for the right beast.</p>

        <p><strong>Tip #3: The Phrase “I’m Here for Cultural Exchange” Covers a Multitude of Sins</strong><br>
          Including long stints in Polish hostels, questionable Lisbon poetry readings, and that regrettable poitín
          tasting in a Luxembourg forest.</p>

        <p><strong>Tip #4: Learn the Local Word for “Eejit”</strong><br>
          Because you will hear it. Often. Especially after quoting Yeats at the tax office.</p>

        <p><strong>Tip #5: Poitín + Existential Homesickness = Song</strong><br>
          This is the formula behind <em>The Exile’s Lament</em>, <em>England</em>, and half of your emotional
          breakdowns. Use responsibly.</p>

        <p><strong>Tip #6: Be Wary of Anyone Who Calls You “Well-Integrated”</strong><br>
          It usually means you’ve stopped dancing at bus stops. Reconsider your life choices.</p>

        <p><strong>Tip #7: Remember — Even Abroad, There’s Always Another Grogan Nearby</strong><br>
          Usually slumped over a pint, humming an unfinished verse, wondering how to rhyme “Eurocrat” with “spleen.”
          Introduce yourself.</p>

        <p>In the end, living abroad is less about success and more about survival — emotional, cultural, poetic. If you
          can’t find meaning, at least find a good pub. And if that fails, write a song and pretend it’s deep.</p>

        <p>You may be lost at sea — but by God, you’ll have a chorus.</p>

    <!-- Blog 5 The Blessed Pint-->
    <section class="blog-entry blog-post" data-category="drink">
      <h2>In Praise of the Blessed Pint</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 29 May 2025</p>
      <p>Some say the black stuff is a drink. Grogan & Brogan know better: it’s a vocation, a philosophy, a slightly
        tragic love affair.</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-brogan-stout-small.jpg" alt="Grogan writing poetry while Brogan raises a pint of stout"
        class="story-image" style="max-width: 15%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;">

      <span id="entry7" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 In Praise of the Blessed Pint</p>

        <p>There are men who drink to forget, and men who drink to remember. Grogan and Brogan drink because the pint
          winked first.</p>

        <p>It began, as most things do, in Ballymahone. Grogan had written a lament to a missing sock. Brogan had tried
          to bottle poitín using recycled holy water. Both were banned from the parish newsletter.</p>

        <p>So they wandered — west, then east, then vaguely sideways — until they reached a pub whose name neither can
          recall but whose stout “tasted like forgiveness.”</p>

        <p><strong>What makes Irish stout holy?</strong><br>
          It is black as the souls of bishops. Creamy as a nun’s sigh. It settles, as all things should. It teaches
          patience, penance, and quiet songcraft. It stains your moustache and soul in equal measure.</p>

        <p>Grogan says a proper pint should be poured in silence, observed like an eclipse, and then spoken to gently —
          as one would a haunted fiddle.</p>

        <p>Brogan disagrees. He believes the pint is a mirror. “It shows you what’s inside. That’s why it’s black.”</p>

        <p>Between them, they’ve composed 37 verses on the virtues of stout, including one accidentally recited at a
          cousin’s funeral and another banned by the Galway Tourism Board for “blasphemous agricultural metaphors.”</p>

        <p>Of course, there are rules:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Never toast without eye contact. It may summon banshees.</li>
          <li>Never trust a pint you didn’t see poured. (This applies to priests and pints alike.)</li>
          <li>Never write poetry while drinking stout unless you are prepared to weep or propose marriage to a statue.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>In Luxembourg, the lads tried local brews. “It’s like stout,” said Brogan, “if stout forgot who it was and
          married into a Belgian family.”</p>

        <p>So they returned to their roots. Or at least their stools. Grogan with a notebook full of epiphanies, Brogan
          with a face like rain and two half-verses about foam.</p>

        <p>The pint remains. Steady. Silky. Sly.</p>

        <p>And somewhere in the corner, as the head settles and the silence ripples, Grogan and Brogan raise their
          glasses and toast to the only religion they’ve never abandoned:</p>

        <p><em>The Blessed Pint.</em></p>

    <!-- Blog 6 Donkey in Irish Traditional Music-->
    <section class="blog-entry blog-post" data-category="countrylife">
      <h2>The Donkey in Irish Traditional Music</h2>
      <p class=" date">Posted on 29 May 2025</p>
      <p>They carried turf, saints, poitín, and prophets. Now they carry meaning — especially in the songs of Grogan &
        Brogan.</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-brogan-donkey-small.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan donkey with wreath, poitín jugs, and turf"
        class="blog-image" style="max-width: 25%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;">


      <span id="entry8" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 The Donkey in Irish Traditional Music — and in the hearts of Grogan & Brogan</p>

        <p>The Irish donkey is more than a beast of burden. She is a muse, a martyr, a mobile metaphor. In folk music,
          she’s often the one character who never complains, even as she hauls seaweed, turf, or Grogan himself back
          from the fair in Ballymahone.</p>

        <p>Historically, the donkey featured as the humble workmate of the peasantry — the rural backbone pulling carts
          through bog and boreen. But in song, she has evolved. In Grogan & Brogan’s universe, she achieves something
          higher: poetic elevation.</p>

        <p>Consider <strong>“Rainbow,”</strong> Grogan’s equine soulmate and emotional anchor. She’s not just a donkey.
          She’s a confidante, a critic, a creature who outlasts the wife, the landlord, and the tax inspector. The
          refrain practically writes itself:</p>

        <p><em>“Your song be abrasive, but for melody I’d have bought a parrot.”</em></p>

        <p>Brogan claims to have once placed a winning bet on a donkey race in Louth. The donkey’s name was “Maud Gonne
          with Teeth.” The payout funded several failed romantic ventures and the first draft of <em>The Book of
            Blarney, Vol. II</em>.</p>

        <p>But the donkey is not merely comic relief. In <strong>“Mental Health in the West of Ireland in
            1968,”</strong> the donkey becomes a conversational partner — wise, silent, non-judging. The priest might
          deliver penance, the doctor prescriptions, but the donkey? She listens.</p>

        <p>It’s no surprise that when Grogan once tried to write a spiritual ballad without mentioning a donkey, his pen
          snapped in half. Brogan declared it divine intervention.</p>

        <p>To summarise: In Irish song, the donkey may seem lowly — but she carries high truths. She endures where
          others falter. She knows where the bones are buried. And in the songs of Grogan & Brogan, she’s every bit as
          important as the bard himself.</p>

        <p>So next time you hear a bray from the back field, don’t ignore it. It might just be the beginning of your
          next chorus.</p>

      <h2>Poitín & Philosophy: The True Spirit of Irish Thought</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 29 May 2025</p>
      <p>Before Socrates had hemlock, Brogan had poitín. Only one of them lived to finish his thoughts — and his pint.
      </p>

      <img src="assets/grogan-poitin-banner-small.jpg" alt="Grogan writing in a notebook, Poitín Philosopher style"

      <span id="entry9" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 Poitín & Philosophy: The True Spirit of Irish Thought</p>

        <p>It’s often said that Ireland’s two great exports are saints and song. But Grogan & Brogan argue there’s a
          third: <strong>epistemological inebriation</strong>, bottled and passed hand to hand since the dawn of turf.
        </p>

        <p>Grogan claims he wrote his finest verse after “consulting the smoky angel.” Brogan once declared: “The Holy
          Spirit is 70% proof and doesn’t like being questioned.” Together, they have forged a sacred school of thought
          known locally as <em>The Lismore Lounge of Speculative Intoxication.</em></p>

        <p>But this is not mere drunkenness. This is <strong>structured confusion</strong> — a long-standing tradition
          in which poitín serves as both *sacrament and solvent* for metaphysical inquiry.</p>

        <p><strong>Key principles of the Poitín School include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reality is bendable — especially after the third glass.</li>
          <li>Truth is like mist: beautiful, elusive, and best observed through the bottom of a jar.</li>
          <li>Every meaningful conversation starts with “I probably shouldn’t be telling you this...”</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In *Roses and Poitín*, Grogan attempts courtship using theological praise and poetic slurring. In *Give the
          Devil His Due*, he reaches moral enlightenment in the form of lyrical compromise. Brogan, meanwhile, once
          hallucinated a donkey quoting Kant. (“Categorical imperative? Get out of my field.”)</p>

        <p>It’s said that when Joyce left Ireland, he took two suitcases: one for clothes and one for smuggled truth.
          Grogan & Brogan would argue you only need the second — and a bottle to go with it.</p>

        <p>So pour a dram, open your third eye (and close your second), and let poitín guide your hand and undo your
          doubt. Just don’t forget what you wrote. Or where you wrote it. Or who you wrote it for.</p>

        <p>As Brogan once muttered, forehead against the bar: <em>“If Descartes had poitín, he would’ve doubted
            quicker.”</em></p>

      <h2>Rural Ireland: A Love Letter in Turf and Absurdity</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 30 May 2025</p>
      <p>It is where time slows, donkeys whisper, and your sins are between you and the priest — unless he’s in the poem
        too.</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-holy-well-small.jpg" alt="Grogan writing beside a rural holy well marked 'Tobar Naofa'"
        class="blog-image" style="max-width: 25%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;">


      <span id="entry10" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 Rural Ireland: A Love Letter in Turf and Absurdity</p>

        <p>For Grogan & Brogan, rural Ireland isn’t a place — it’s a condition. A metaphysical peat bog where
          melancholy, magic, and mischief grow side by side. Where the rosary shares shelf space with a jar of poitín
          and the donkey knows more than the bishop.</p>

        <p>Grogan calls it “The birthplace of longing.” Brogan calls it “the only place you can be broke, drunk, poetic
          and still invited to dinner.”</p>

        <p>From <strong>Fishing Boats at Sea</strong>:</p>
        <p><em>“In their beds, the emptiness of the starched clean sheets,
            Recalls the shapes that once to this house did keep…”</em></p>

        <p>Here, silence speaks louder than sermon, and the land remembers. The characters of Grogan & Brogan’s ballads
          may wander far — to Birmingham, Boston or perdition — but their thoughts always stray homeward, to the bog,
          the boreen, the barrel of rain.</p>

        <p>In <strong>Rainbow</strong>, a man’s deepest connection isn’t to his departed wife or estranged kin — but to
          his donkey:</p>
        <p><em>“Dear God in heaven, may the donkeys be blessed,
            They’ve toiled in the fields and ever gave of their best…”</em></p>

        <p>Rural Ireland is where saints are sarcastic and prophets wear gumboots. In <strong>Mental Health in the West
            of Ireland</strong>, the narrator’s only stable companion is a donkey named Rainbow — with whom he shares
          his diagnosis, his doubts, and likely his lunch.</p>

        <p><em>“Sir, do I write in pencil or in pen?”
            “Here’s a pair of scissors, cut a hole in your finger and write it out in blood.”</em></p>

        <p>And in <strong>The Exile’s Lament</strong>, the land itself is a lost lover, remembered in dreams more
          vividly than any city street:</p>
        <p><em>“They all revolve around the valleys fair and green,
            Fairer than any maiden I have ever seen…”</em></p>

        <p>For Grogan & Brogan, rural Ireland is not perfect. It’s tough, harsh, rain-soaked and ecclesiastically
          confusing. But it’s home. It’s the muse. It’s the thing worth singing about — again and again, until the turf
          runs out and the bottle’s dry.</p>

        <p>And that’s why they keep writing.</p>

      <h2>Fishing the Irish Sea: Salt, Song & Survival</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 30 May 2025</p>
      <p>It’s not just work. It’s myth. It’s mourning. It’s where Grogan & Brogan cast their lines into history — and
        hauled back verses.</p>

      <img src="assets/grogan-fishing-blog-small.jpg"
        alt="Grogan writing on a rocky Irish shore at dawn, with a fishing boat in the background" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 15%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;">


      <span id="entry11" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 Fishing the Irish Sea: Salt, Song & Survival</p>

        <p>Fishing has always been more than industry in Irish life. It’s a spiritual act. A wager. A song waiting to
          happen. For Grogan & Brogan, the sea is a stage where tragedy, communion, and the occasional ghost all take
          their bow.</p>

        <p>In <strong>Fishing Boats at Sea</strong>, the nets are full of more than herring. The boats return — but not
          all the men do:</p>
        <p><em>“Upon the wall, are the pictures of those who did not return,
            From the ocean, whose nets and gear were spurned…”</em></p>

        <p>The sea in these songs is both cruel and consoling — a paradox as Irish as a pint in the rain. In
          <strong>Lost at Sea</strong>, the fisherman pleads with his mother — and the elements — for safe return. It’s
          a ballad of aching devotion, weather-beaten fear, and Atlantic resolve.
        </p>

        <p><em>“There was a strange electric smell in the air,
            And the seagulls were wheeling as our nets we did repair.”</em></p>

        <p>Back on land, <strong>Lament of the Fisherman’s Wife</strong> gives voice to those left behind. A litany of
          rising tension, debt, calving cows, whiskey guilt, and the hard reality that the sea provides — but it also
          takes.</p>

        <p><em>“Get out of bed ye,
            The ocean’s waiting to provide,
            Though it swallowed our brothers,
            In it our hopes we must confide.”</em></p>

        <p>And then there’s Grogan himself, whose poems smell of brine and whose lyrics read like messages found in
          bottles washed ashore. Brogan, meanwhile, swears he once dated a mermaid near Ballycotton. (No witnesses.)</p>

        <p>Fishing, for Grogan & Brogan, is not just about food or trade. It’s about memory, longing, and the unending
          Irish dialogue with the sea. A song line tossed like a net. A silence deep as the tide. And always — always —
          the hope that the boat returns.</p>

      <h2>Gaeilge: Teanga na Fola, na Filíochta, agus na Fadhbanna</h2>
      <p class="date">Foilsithe ar 30 Bealtaine 2025</p>
      <p>Is í an Ghaeilge croítheanga G&B — fiú nuair nach dtuigeann siad a chéile, tuigtear an rud is tábhachtaí.</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-as-gaeilge-small.jpg"
        alt="Grogan holding a pocket Irish-English dictionary beside a Gaeltacht signpost" class="blog-image"

      <span id="entry12" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 Gaeilge: Teanga na Fola, na Filíochta, agus na Fadhbanna</p>

        <p>Is minic a chloistear Grogan ag rá: “Tá mo chroí i nGaeilge, ach tá mo inchinn fós ag aistriú.” Agus Brogan?
          “Is breá liom Gaeilge — ach is fuath léi mé.”</p>

        <p>I bhfírinne, tá caidreamh G&B leis an Ghaeilge cosúil lena gcaidreamh le poitín: <strong>beagán de mhagadh,
            beagán de mhistéir, agus an iomarca de bhrí.</strong></p>

        <p>Is léir an Ghaeilge sna hamhráin mar <em>Dying Tongues</em> agus <em>Letter from Donegal Airport</em>, ina
          gcailltear duine i n-aerfort iargúlta de bharr míthuiscint teanga. Ach tá sé greannmhar freisin:</p>

        <p><em>“Dúirt sí 'Fan ansin,' agus shíl mé gur ainm an bhaile é…”</em></p>

        <p>Bhí iarracht ag Grogan uair amháin sean-nós a chanadh i gCorca Dhuibhne, ach d’fhág sé leis an línte seo:</p>
        <p><em>“Ó mo chroí, níl a fhios agam an briathar don téarma sin — ach tá sé brónach go leor mar atá.”</em></p>

        <p>Dóibh, is bealach í an Ghaeilge chun an stair a mhothú, na máithreacha a chloisteáil arís, agus rudaí a rá
          nach féidir i mBéarla gan casacht nó caint faoi aimsir na Peig.</p>

        <p>Ag deireadh an lae, is breá le G&B an Ghaeilge, fiú má dhéanann sí crá orthu. Agus is é sin a dhéanann an grá
          fíor — buan, deacair, ach lán le ceol.</p>

        <p><em>“Is minic a thuig an t-éan an fhilíocht nár thuig an fear — ach bhí sé á chanadh ar aon nós.”</em></p>

      <h2>“Un Verre de Poitín, s’il vous plaît”: Grogan & Brogan, French, and the Art of Exile</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 30 May 2025</p>
      <p>Grogan & Brogan speak French like they speak truth — awkwardly, poetically, and usually after one too many.</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-in-luxembourg-small.jpg"
        alt="Grogan walking and writing in the winding lanes of Luxembourg" class="blog-image"

      <span id="entry13" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 “Un Verre de Poitín, s’il vous plaît”: G&B, French, and the Art of Exile</p>

        <p>For Grogan & Brogan, French is less a language than a *mood*. A vague perfume of melancholy and mischief that
          drifts into their songs whenever the Liffey seems too narrow for their European dreams.</p>

        <p>Living in Luxembourg — surrounded by bureaucrats, bankers, and baguettes — they found themselves uttering
          phrases like “non remboursable” and “l’identité européenne” with increasing regularity. And as always, the
          songs followed.</p>

        <p>In <strong>La Mariée de Portbou</strong>, Grogan reaches for French to approach a story too sad for English.
          The rhythm of the lines reflects the language’s elegance, even as the theme remains tragic:</p>
        <p><em>“Tu étais couchée,
            Sous les fleurs blanches de la mer…”</em></p>

        <p>Meanwhile, in <strong>The Drunken Paddy Reincarnated</strong>, Brogan waxes philosophical about Irishness
          abroad, calling himself “le dernier poète de la buvette.” He claims Joyce came to him in a dream, quoting
          Foucault in a Westmeath accent.</p>

        <p>And in <strong>The Irish Winnie the Pooh</strong>, we hear the surreal collision of Gaelic soul and Gallic
          flourish:</p>
        <p><em>“Mon dieu, said the donkey,
            Where is the honey of my youth?”</em></p>

        <p>For G&B, French offers *distance* — from home, from heartbreak, from the stiff collars of Irish tradition.
          It’s a poetic passport that allows them to drift through memory and myth without declaring customs.</p>

        <p>They still don’t speak French very well. But they sing it with feeling. And sometimes that’s more than
          enough.</p>

        <p>As Brogan once told a Luxembourg waiter who corrected his accent:
          <em>“Ah non, monsieur. I’m not trying to speak French. I’m trying to feel it.”</em>
        </p>

      <h2>Grogan & Brogan sprechen Deutsch?</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 31 May 2025</p>
      <p>How did two Irish-rooted lads end up crooning in German? Sit tight...</p>

      <img src="assets/grogan-berlin-small.jpg" alt="Grogan reading Rilke with a pint and a sheep in Berlin"
        class="blog-image" style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />



      <span id="entry14" style="display:none;">

        <p>🎶 <em>Grogan & Brogan sprechen Deutsch?</em></p>

        <p>It began — as many G&B adventures do — in a Luxembourgish bus shelter during a thunderstorm. Brogan was
          attempting to translate the chorus of *Whiskey in the Jar* into Hochdeutsch. Grogan was trying to remember the
          dative case while holding a dripping bodhrán. Someone shouted "Dat ass kee Reen, dat ass eng Apokalips!" and
          the rest, as they say, is history.</p>

        <p>But the truth runs deeper.</p>

        <p>Grogan (that’s me) has long harboured a linguistic itch. Raised on Irish rebel songs and Rainier Maria Rilke
          (blame the nuns), I fell in love with the angular poetics of the German tongue. There’s something in the way
          it holds a phrase — like a stone in the mouth — that reminds me of old Irish.</p>

        <p>Brogan was less enthusiastic. “German,” he once declared, “is like a cupboard full of consonants falling down
          the stairs.” But even he admitted, over a Spätzle-laced supper, that certain German words — *Sehnsucht*,
          *Heimat*, *Vergänglichkeit* — carried the same ache as a good Irish lament.</p>

        <p>So we began to experiment. Not out of pretension, but out of curiosity. What would it mean to sing an Irish
          song in German? Would it become a parody, a prayer, a punchline?</p>

        <p>Turns out — all three.</p>

        <p>We now have songs where the verses swing in English and the choruses lurch into German. Others where Grogan
          recites a poetic curse in Goethe’s tongue while Brogan hums *The Rocky Road to Dublin* underneath. We've
          written one about a grandfather in Namibia (*Großvater Herero*) and another that just repeats “Bratkartoffeln”
          to the rhythm of *Óró Sé do Bheatha ‘Bhaile*.</p>

        <p>Why?</p>

        <p>Because the Irish soul doesn’t stop at Shannon Airport. And sometimes, when you’ve been away from home long
          enough, German sounds more Irish than English ever could.</p>

        <p>It’s in the longing. The exile. The strange, stubborn beauty.</p>

        <p>And yes — sometimes it’s just because the word *Schmetterling* makes Brogan giggle like a six-year-old with a
          tin whistle.</p>

        <p>We’re not trying to be clever. We’re trying to be honest. About how messy and marvellous language can be when
          you’ve got too many homes, too many hearts, and not enough syllables to go round.</p>

        <p>If you ever hear an accordion wheeze out a line of Brecht in a Cork accent — that’s probably us.</p>

        <p>Danke und slán,</p>

        <p><strong>Grogan (und ein bisschen Brogan)</strong></p>

      <p class="date">Posted on 31 May 2025</p>
      <p>What are two Irish lads doing writing songs about Namibia? It's not what you think...</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan_brogan_namibia_web_optimized_800x800.webp" alt="Grogan in Namibia" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry15" style="display:none;">

        <p>🌍 <em>“It’s a long way from Ballymahone to Lüderitz.”</em></p>

        <p>That’s what Brogan said the first time we stood on the red earth near Shark Island — looking out at a cruel
          Atlantic that had carried so many Irish out, and so many others in.</p>

        <p>Namibia isn’t a place you expect to find in an Irish folk song. But for us, it was inevitable.</p>

        <p>You see, Grogan’s grandfather — the mysterious “Großvater Herero” — served under a German flag in the
          colonial South West Africa campaigns. The details are muddy. Some say he deserted. Some say he joined the Nama
          resistance. All we know for certain is that he returned with a battered accordion and a hatred of uniforms.
        </p>

        <p>Our song <strong><em>Großvater Herero</em></strong> is part family myth, part confession. It tells of guilt
          passed down like a tarnished heirloom. Of desert silence that never forgets. It’s a song where German mixes
          with Afrikaans, and history refuses to stay buried.</p>

        <p>Another piece, <strong><em>Shark Island Lament</em></strong>, follows the windblown ghosts of that
          concentration camp near Lüderitz — a song written for those whose names are not in the museums, but in the
          sand. The Irish in us saw it and knew it: colonisation doesn’t change its clothes, just its accent.</p>

        <p>Namibia showed us what happens when maps are drawn in blood and sand. And it made us wonder: where else has
          Ireland left its footprints, even where it never meant to?</p>

        <p>So yes — Namibia. A place of endless sky, and bottomless grief. But also of song. And sometimes that’s all we
          have to offer — a song, an old accordion, a memory passed down like a wound that sings.</p>

        <p>If you ever hear a G&B tune with a desert drone and a Berlin echo, now you know why.</p>

        <p>With dust in our boots and guilt in our harmonies,</p>

      <h2>Grogan & Brogan’s Worst Gig</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 31 May 2025</p>
      <p>You think you've had a bad night? Try this on for size…</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-worst-gig-with-brogan-small.jpg" alt="Grogan's Worst Gig" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry5" style="display:none;">

        <p>🎤 <em>“The soundman was drunk, the mic was dead, and the only person clapping was a dog.”</em></p>

        <p>That, in a nutshell, was <strong>Grogan & Brogan’s worst gig</strong>. But it started, as these things do,
          with misplaced hope and a dodgy promise.</p>

        <p>We were booked to play at what was billed as the “Kilcar Cultural Weekender.” The poster had a harp, a pint,
          and what appeared to be the ghost of Patrick Kavanagh photoshopped into a kayak. We should have known.</p>

        <p>The venue turned out to be the back room of a chipper, directly adjacent to the fryer. Half the crowd were
          there for battered sausages. The other half were the staff.</p>

        <p>Brogan had tuned his bouzouki to open C# minor for dramatic effect. Grogan opened with a heartfelt rendition
          of <em>“Lament for a Lost Librarian.”</em> The silence that followed could have cured insomnia.</p>

        <p>Things got worse. The organiser vanished halfway through. The “lighting technician” was a teenager with a
          vape and a torch. Midway through our third number, a fight broke out near the condiment counter — allegedly
          over who invented curry chips.</p>

        <p>The final straw? A child climbed onto the “stage” and screamed: <strong>“YOU’RE NOT EVEN ON
            SPOTIFY!”</strong></p>

        <p>He was right. We weren’t. We still aren’t.</p>

        <p>We finished our set with the dignity of monks on fire and collected our fee: two cans of Club Orange and a
          voucher for garlic mushrooms (expired). Brogan wept silently into his accordion case. Grogan took a vow never
          to perform again in any venue where coleslaw is served by the litre.</p>

        <p>So yes, that was the worst gig.</p>

        <p>But the thing is — we still wrote a song about it. And the dog did clap. With its tail. And sometimes, that’s
          enough.</p>

        <p>Never again, Kilcar. Unless the cheque clears.</p>

      <h2>Grogan, Memory & the Madness of History</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 31 May 2025</p>
      <p>He’s a man of many tunes and a memory like a museum. But what exactly is Grogan's relationship with history?
      </p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-history-small.jpg" alt="Grogan looking into the past" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry16" style="display:none;">

        <p>🕯 <em>“History isn’t a story, it’s a haunting.”</em> — Grogan, to Brogan, somewhere between Doolin and Dún
          Laoghaire.</p>

        <p>Grogan has always been fascinated by the past — not in the way of academics or archivists, but like a man
          who's convinced the dead are still whispering. Whether in a famine field, an abandoned convent, or a pub that
          remembers the Tan War better than its drink prices, Grogan listens.</p>

        <p>And the past speaks to him. In songs.</p>

        <p>Take <strong><em>The Exile’s Lament</em></strong>: a song that blurs the sorrow of one man’s forced departure
          from Ireland with the wider grief of a nation broken by emigration. Or <strong><em>Großvater
              Herero</em></strong>, which traces a familial thread back to colonial Namibia and unearths not just
          ancestry, but atrocity.</p>

        <p>There’s reverence in these songs — for loss, for dignity, for complexity. But there’s also a slyness. Grogan
          never lets sentimentality rot the roots. Songs like <strong><em>Paddy Macaroni</em></strong> and
          <strong><em>The Bard of Ballymahone</em></strong> poke fun at Ireland’s obsession with its own myths, even
          while participating in them.
        </p>

        <p>Brogan once said: <em>“Grogan respects history the way a cat respects furniture — it’s sacred, but still gets
            clawed.”</em></p>

        <p>That’s true. In <strong><em>Shark Island Lament</em></strong>, we hear Grogan's reverence in the way he
          channels the voice of the dead — but his rage seeps through in the very choice to sing about something so many
          have forgotten.</p>

        <p>In other songs — like <strong><em>The Poet of Old</em></strong> — Grogan takes history personally. It’s not
          some distant tapestry. It’s a coat he wears, even if it’s itchy. Memory is not a luxury. It’s the price of
          being awake.</p>

        <p>And so, in every verse, he reanimates the past. Not as nostalgia — but as resistance.</p>

        <p>In the G&B universe, history is not a thing that happened. It’s a ghost that still sings. And Grogan, despite
          his cranky scepticism, remains its unlikely cantor — braying, ballading, bellowing… for all the voices that
          never got to.</p>

      <h2>Grogan & Brogan on Mental Health</h2>
      <p class=" date">Posted on 31 May 2025</p>
      <p>It’s not all poitín and punchlines. Sometimes, it’s just you and the silence…</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-mental-health-small.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan on Mental Health" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry17" style="display:none;">

        <p>🧠 <em>“I talk to my donkey. The donkey doesn’t answer. And somehow that helps.”</em> — Grogan</p>

        <p>For all the laughs, the wigs, the wild gigs and wandering, Grogan & Brogan have never shied away from the
          shadows. If anything, they walk beside them — quietly, stubbornly, like men who know the road is long and
          often lonely.</p>

        <p>In songs like <strong><em>Mental Health in the West of Ireland (1968)</em></strong>, we hear it clearly: a
          world where men talk to animals because there’s no one else to talk to. Where emotional pain is wrapped in
          silence, or smothered under a layer of turf smoke and sarcasm.</p>

        <p>Grogan has never claimed to have answers. But he has songs. And sometimes that’s the first light in the bog.
        </p>

        <p><strong><em>Without You</em></strong> offers another take — a raw, almost prayer-like appeal to love as the
          thread that holds us together. Not romantic love. But the kind that keeps you going when your own mind tries
          to leave you behind.</p>

        <p>There’s humour too — because there has to be. <strong><em>The Mad Priest of Ballynahinch</em></strong> might
          raise eyebrows, but it’s also a portrait of someone unravelled by guilt, faith, and the quiet violence of
          isolation.</p>

        <p>Brogan puts it simply: <em>“We write these songs because we needed them ourselves first.”</em></p>

        <p>And maybe that’s the point. Not to fix it. Not to tidy it. But to say it. To sing it. To give the sadness a
          tune, so it has somewhere to go.</p>

        <p>If you’ve ever stared at the sea too long, or felt too tired to explain the storm in your chest, know this:
          Grogan’s probably already written it down. And Brogan’s somewhere behind him, tuning the bouzouki.</p>

      <h2>Grogan & Aleksandr Blok: A Strange Devotion</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 31 May 2025</p>
      <p>You wouldn’t think an Irish cultural Appropriator would find a kindred soul in a dead Russian Symbolist. But
        then again, you
        haven’t met Grogan.</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-and-blok-alt-small.jpg" alt="Grogan and Aleksandr Blok" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry8" style="display:none;">

        <p>📖 <em>“I do not love the living — only the dead who still speak.”</em> — Grogan, quoting Blok to a startled
          Latvian customs officer</p>

        <p>There are obsessions. And then there’s Grogan’s relationship with the Russian poet Aleksandr Blok
          (1880–1921).</p>

        <p>It began in St. Petersburg, 1998. Grogan was meant to be teaching English. Instead, he found himself in a
          crumbling stairwell, clutching a samizdat copy of <em>The Twelve</em> and wondering why every Russian seemed
          to walk with their soul outside their body.</p>

        <p>Blok’s poetry — mystical, doomed, aching with history — hit him like a communion chalice to the back of the
          head. Grogan, already susceptible to ghostly voices and metaphysical rain, was hooked.</p>

        <p>In Blok, he found a brother in lyric exile: someone who worshipped beauty but also feared it. Someone who
          loved the past so much it nearly killed him.</p>

        <p>This devotion appears — sideways — in several G&B songs. <strong><em>Voice of the Mystic
              Homeland</em></strong> owes its cadence to Blok’s symbolist rhythms. <strong><em>Without You</em></strong>
          carries the same tremble between longing and ruin. Even <strong><em>La Mariée de Portbou</em></strong>, though
          in French, is soaked in that Blokian atmosphere — where trains disappear, women become apparitions, and time
          itself unravels into snow.</p>

        <p>Brogan tolerates this fixation with the good humour of a man who once caught Grogan whispering “O mysterious
          Lady” into a glass of kvass.</p>

        <p>But it runs deep. Blok gave Grogan permission — not to be Russian — but to be haunted. To carry the weight of
          culture without needing to explain it. To write songs that ache not with memory, but with the <em>absence</em>
          of memory.</p>

        <p>As Grogan put it: <em>“I don’t understand Blok. That’s why I love him.”</em></p>

        <p>And somewhere in a snowy alley of Petrograd, a ghost smiles through his pince-nez.</p>

      <h2>Grogan on Childhood Memories</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 31 May 2025</p>
      <p>Not all memories are golden. Some are turf-smoked, others half-sour. And some wear short trousers and never
        quite leave...</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-childhood-small.jpg" alt="Grogan on Childhood Memories" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry19" style="display:none;">

        <p>🪀 <em>“The past is a goat in the living room. You can ignore it, but it will still eat your curtains.”</em>
          — Grogan</p>

        <p>Grogan doesn’t talk much about childhood — unless he’s had poitín. Or heard the sound of a football against a
          gable wall. Or caught the faint smell of wet linoleum and boiled ham. Then the veil lifts.</p>

        <p>There are glimpses in his songs. <strong><em>Your Father is Dead</em></strong> is a knife of a memory, drawn
          from a real-life cruelty that left its mark in lowercase letters. It’s not sentimental — it’s surgical. And
          true.</p>

        <p><strong><em>The Artist</em></strong> reaches back too — to a boy who saw the world differently and got
          smacked for it. Who drew saints in biro and was told not to be soft. Who wanted a pencil, and got a rake.</p>

        <p>For Grogan, memory isn’t a scrapbook. It’s a battleground. Some of it tender. Some of it unbearable. And yet
          — he never discards it. He shapes it into songs. He turns it, like turf, until it’s dry enough to burn.</p>

        <p>Even the comic ones, like <strong><em>Mental Health in the West of Ireland (1968)</em></strong>, are filled
          with echoes of boyhood misunderstanding — listening in on adult sadness without the language to name it.</p>

        <p>Brogan once found Grogan staring at a cracked toy fire engine and asked if he was alright. Grogan replied:
          <em>“I’m grand. Just remembering what it’s like to be five and already broken-hearted.”</em>
        </p>

        <p>He writes it down. He sings it. And somewhere in the song, the goat in the living room settles down. For a
          while.</p>

      <h2>Grogan & Brogan on the Islands of Ireland</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 31 May 2025</p>
      <p>Not every exile crosses an ocean. Some only drift a few miles west — and never return.</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-islands-small.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan on the Islands of Ireland" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry20" style="display:none;">

        <p>⛴️ <em>“The sea isn’t water. It’s silence with weather.”</em> — Grogan, watching the Arranmore ferry vanish
          in fog</p>

        <p>Grogan has always had a thing for islands. Not just the obvious kind — the Inishbofins, Torys, and Valentias
          — but the emotional ones. The psychic rock outcroppings where old people tell stories to the wind and children
          leave without saying goodbye.</p>

        <p>He wrote <strong><em>Lost at Sea</em></strong> after staring out at Skellig Michael for too long. He claims
          the island hummed back at him. Brogan thinks it was just hunger. Either way, the song speaks of those left
          behind — and those who never came home.</p>

        <p>There’s something about islands in Irish consciousness. We project things onto them. Saints. Ghosts. Old
          lovers. Wild goats. Grogan once spent a week on Clare Island talking to a stone circle and came back with
          three verses and a sunburn.</p>

        <p>In <strong><em>Fishing Boats at Sea</em></strong>, Grogan’s islands become metaphors for men — unreachable,
          rugged, watching the world from afar. In <strong><em>The Emigrant’s Regret</em></strong>, the island is home:
          a dot in the Atlantic that haunts the emigrant’s dreams like a prayer they forgot how to say.</p>

        <p>Brogan, as usual, is more practical: <em>“An island’s grand if you’ve a boat. Or a pub.”</em></p>

        <p>But for Grogan, the islands are poems without stanzas. They don't need to rhyme. They just need to be.
          Remote. Wounded. Defiant.</p>

        <p>We all carry a few islands inside us. Some with music. Some with silence. Some we’ll never visit again —
          except in song.</p>

      <h2>Grogan & Brogan and the Butterflies of Ireland</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 31 May 2025</p>
      <p>They say butterflies don’t belong in Irish weather. But like poems, grief, and divilment — they come anyway.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-butterflies-small.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan and the Butterflies of Ireland"
        class="blog-image" style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry21" style="display:none;">

        <p>🦋 <em>“A butterfly is just a ghost with better timing.”</em> — Grogan</p>

        <p>Grogan has long held a quiet obsession with Irish butterflies. Not in a collector’s way — he doesn’t pin or
          label. He watches. He notes. He listens.</p>

        <p>There’s a sense in his songs that butterflies are not insects, but messages. From where? From whom? He never
          says. But in <strong><em>Voice of the Mystic Homeland</em></strong>, one drifts through the final verse like a
          spirit choosing not to stay. In <strong><em>Rainbow</em></strong>, a butterfly appears beside the donkey —
          both mysterious, both holy in their own stubborn way.</p>

        <p>Brogan calls them “fluttering lies from the hedge.” But even he paused once when a Painted Lady landed on his
          guitar string and stayed for a full verse.</p>

        <p>In Irish folklore, butterflies can be the souls of the dead. In G&B mythology, they’re part of a deeper world
          — not symbolic, but actual. They don’t represent freedom. They are freedom. Fleeting, lovely, impossible to
          follow without losing yourself.</p>

        <p>Grogan once chased a Green Hairstreak across the Burren and lost track of time for three hours. He returned
          with a sunburn, a half-written stanza, and a wild look in his eyes. “She was teaching me a new scale,” he
          said.</p>

        <p>And so they keep appearing. In lyrics. In gardens. In graveyards. On stage once, during <strong><em>Fishing
              Boats at Sea</em></strong>, a Red Admiral landed on Grogan’s notebook. He closed it gently. The song ended
          early that night.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you follow the butterfly. Sometimes it follows you.</p>

      <h2>Grogan on Gaelic Curse Words</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 1 June 2025</p>
      <p>They don’t swear in Irish. They cast spells. They bend the air. And Grogan should know — he’s been hexed twice.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-gaelic-cursewords-small.jpg" alt="Grogan on Gaelic Curse Words" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry22" style="display:none;">

        <p>💀 <em>“An English curse is a punch. An Irish one is a slow, delicious drowning.”</em> — Grogan</p>

        <p>There’s a reason Grogan collects old Irish curse words the way some people collect stamps or pub coasters.
          It’s not to use them — it’s to <em>understand</em> them. To feel their weight. Their music. Their generational
          venom.</p>

        <p>Take <strong><em>“Go ndéana an diabhal dréimire de chnámh do dhroma ag dreapadh go hIfreann.”</em></strong> —
          “May the devil make a ladder of your backbone while climbing down to Hell.”</p>

        <p>It’s not rage. It’s <em>craft</em>. It’s storytelling with a grudge.</p>

        <p>Brogan once described Gaelic cursing as “a kind of aggressive poetry.” Grogan disagreed. He said it was “a
          folk religion. A way of evening the score when all other powers have failed.”</p>

        <p>In songs like <strong><em>The Mad Priest of Ballynahinch</em></strong> and <strong><em>Ó mo
              chroí</em></strong>, you’ll hear traces — not literal curses, but the same energy: incantations laced with
          grief, bile, and beauty. Sometimes Grogan includes a line that sounds harmless until you realise it translates
          roughly as “May your cows calve sideways forever.”</p>

        <p>His grandmother once cursed a tax inspector using only a prayer and a weather report. It snowed sideways for
          three days. Grogan took notes.</p>

        <p>Modern English swearing bores him. It’s blunt. Efficient. Transactional. Irish cursing is theatrical.
          Ceremonial. It takes its time. You don’t <em>drop</em> a Gaelic curse. You <em>compose</em> it.</p>

        <p>And you don’t say it when you’re angry. You say it when you’re <strong>ready</strong>.</p>

        <p>So next time you hear a line that begins with “Go bhfóire Dia ort…” — listen closely. It might sound like a
          blessing. But if Grogan is saying it, check your cattle, your luck, and your back.</p>

      <h2>Grogan &amp; Brogan on Conflicts Between Grogan &amp; Brogan</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 4 June 2025</p>
      <p>“We never fight,” Grogan insists. “We engage in prolonged thematic divergence.” Brogan disagrees. “We fight.
        But we do it like gentlemen — with metaphors and bad posture.”</p>

      <img src="assets/grogan-brogan-conflict-optimised.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan mid-disagreement" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry23" style="display:none;">
        <p>⚔️ <em>“There was once a three-day silence over whether the word ‘lilt’ could be used in a ballad about a
            drowning,” says Brogan. “I stand by the pause.”</em></p>

        <p>Their conflicts are rarely loud — but often operatic in tone. “It’s less shouting,” Grogan explains, “and
          more prolonged sighing across a field.”</p>

        <p>Topics of dispute include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Whether melancholy has a tempo.</li>
          <li>How many donkeys can be referenced in a single album.</li>
          <li>Who actually wrote “The Ballad of Margaret’s Elbow.”</li>
          <li>The correct emotional tone for the word ‘jam.’</li>
        </ul>

        <p>They once stopped speaking for a week over a harmonium. “I thought it was out of tune,” Grogan says. “Brogan
          thought I was out of touch.”</p>

        <p>Resolution usually comes through toast, or a walk in mist. “Sometimes,” Brogan says, “we just hear a robin
          and forget what we were arguing about.”</p>

        <p>They agree that conflict, handled right, is a form of editing. “I sharpen his sentimentality,” Grogan says.
          “And I soften his rage,” Brogan replies.</p>

        <p>So yes, they disagree. Often. But always in service of the same thing: the song, the friendship, and the
          shared belief that there is nothing more sacred than a line delivered with conviction — even if it’s about
          chutney.</p>

        <p>🔤 <em>“Zulu punches, but Xhosa whispers and clicks.”</em> — Grogan</p>

        <p>They spent an entire Tuesday debating the merits of consonant architecture. “Zulu,” said Brogan, “has the
          commanding tone of a village chief who’s had three espressos.” “Xhosa,” replied Grogan, “is the music of stars
          having a quiet family argument.”</p>

        <p>Brogan admires the declarative grandeur of Zulu. “If I were to announce my candidacy for King of All Africa,
          I’d do it in Zulu.” Grogan prefers the complexity of Xhosa. “If I were to tell someone I forgive them for
          stealing my goat, but I still remember — it would be in Xhosa.”</p>

        <p>They briefly attempted to learn both languages, using an online course that taught them how to say “My aunt
          is in the forest” with four distinct clicks. “Vital,” said Brogan. “You never know when your aunt might
          wander.”</p>

        <p>Eventually, they agreed that comparing the two was like comparing a lion to a leopard. “One roars,” said
          Brogan. “One disappears and reappears behind your left elbow,” added Grogan.</p>

        <p>So whether you speak Zulu with the power of a royal edict or Xhosa with the grace of a breeze full of meaning
          — speak it with heart, and preferably not with your mouth full.</p>

    <section class="blog-entry blog-post" data-category="life"">
  <h2>Grogan &amp; Brogan on the Ethics of Arguing with Yourself in Public</h2>
  <p class=" date">Posted on 4 June 2025</p>
      <p>“Technically,” says Grogan, “I win every argument I have with myself — but I also lose, which keeps me humble.”
        Brogan adds: “The key is to stage the argument near a duck pond. Then people assume you're eccentric, not
        unstable.”</p>

        class="blog-image" style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry25" style="display:none;">
        <p>🗣️ <em>“Self-disagreement is simply internal democracy played out with bad acoustics.”</em> — Brogan</p>

        <p>They both maintain that arguing with oneself is healthy — provided you observe certain standards: no
          name-calling, no threats involving soup, and definitely no pointing at dogs for emphasis.</p>

        <p>Grogan believes in “internal rehearsal.” “Better to yell at yourself in the bakery queue than say something
          unforgivable to your cousin at Christmas.” Brogan prefers what he calls “experimental narrative testing,”
          often involving hats.</p>

        <p>They differ slightly on tone. Grogan favours sotto voce muttering with hand gestures. Brogan is more
          theatrical — once delivering a soliloquy about damp laundry to a queue of startled tourists in Lisbon.</p>

        <p>“There’s a thin line,” Grogan warns, “between introspection and alarming a librarian.” Brogan nods. “But what
          are librarians for, if not to be gently unsettled?”</p>

        <p>They conclude that it’s not whether you argue with yourself — but how. “Do it with dignity,” Grogan insists.
          “And if you must raise your voice,” Brogan adds, “do it in Latin. People will assume it’s a prayer.”</p>

      <h2>Grogan &amp; Brogan on EU Citizens Retiring in Greenland</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 4 June 2025</p>
      <p>“It’s the only place left where no one asks what you used to do,” says Brogan. “In Greenland,” adds Grogan,
        “you’re just a person who owns too many jumpers and is oddly serene about snow.”</p>

      <img src="assets/grogan-greenland-small.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan retire to Greenland" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry157" style="display:none;">
        <p>🧊 <em>“The main advantage of Greenland,” says Grogan, “is that you no longer have to explain yourself.
            Mostly because no one’s around to ask.”</em></p>

        <p>Brogan was drawn to the stillness. “There’s a silence here,” he says, “that you can lean against.” Grogan
          preferred the bureaucracy. “It’s very calming to deal with officials who only speak Danish and reply to emails
          by sled.”</p>

        <p>They initially worried about winter. “But after forty-three days of darkness, your sense of time just
          dissolves. Like a biscuit in gløgg.”</p>

        <p>They’ve taken to writing letters to Brussels they never post. “Dear Commission,” writes Brogan, “I have
          joined a seal choir and renounced footwear.”</p>

        <p>Grogan tends a small garden of lichen and complaint. “Mostly I grow things that don’t care if they’re
          ignored.”</p>

        <p>Asked whether Greenland is suitable for EU retirees, they both nod solemnly. “It’s perfect,” says Brogan. “No
          banks, no buzzwords, just the wind and the slow, forgiving snow.”</p>

        <p>“And the occasional EU directive caught in a drift,” Grogan adds. “We collect them like sea glass.”</p>

    <!-- Blog 27 B&G on Slip jigs-->

    <section class="blog-entry blog-post" data-category="music">
      <h2>Grogan &amp; Brogan on Whether the Slip Jig Was Meant for People with Three Legs</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 4 June 2025</p>
      <p>“It’s in 9/8,” Grogan says, “which is either a time signature or a cruel joke.” Brogan adds: “No normal person
        moves in threes. Not unless they’re a goat, a spider with scheduling issues, or my Aunt Carmel after sherry.”
      </p>

      <img src="assets/grogan-slipjig-small.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan on the slip jig" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry27" style="display:none;">
        <p>🩰 <em>“It’s not a dance,” Grogan says. “It’s a form of polite collapse.”</em></p>

        <p>They first encountered the slip jig at a village ceilí where a local woman named Sorcha moved like a “phantom
          with unfinished business.” Brogan attempted to join her. “I hopped. I dipped. I panicked. I think I summoned
          something.”</p>

        <p>Grogan once theorised that the slip jig was invented by a fiddler with no regard for human anatomy. “He
          watched someone fall down the stairs and thought, ‘that’s the rhythm I want.’”</p>

        <p>They experimented with extra limbs — socks stuffed into trousers, broom-handles strapped to knees. “Did it
          help?” someone asked. “Only in spirit,” said Brogan. “And only briefly.”</p>

        <p>Grogan prefers waltzes. “They accept your limitations. The slip jig demands your secrets.”</p>

        <p>They finally agreed the slip jig is not meant for mortals. “It’s faerie rhythm,” Grogan whispers. “Something
          older than coordination.”</p>

        <p>So if you ever feel the 9/8 calling you from the field beyond the fence — beware. “It’s not a dance,” Brogan
          warns. “It’s a test. And your knees are not invited.”</p>

      <h2>Grogan &amp; Brogan on Their 10 Favourite Odd Sounds</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 4 June 2025</p>
      <p>“The world is a concert of strange acoustics,” Grogan declares. “You just have to stand still long enough to
        hear the percussion of nonsense.” Brogan nods. “I once mistook a goat sneezing for a door to another dimension.
        It changed me.”</p>

      <img src="assets/grogan-sounds-small.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan listen closely" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry28" style="display:none;">
        <p>🔊 <em>“We don’t collect stamps,” says Brogan. “We collect noises.”</em></p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>The sound of a teabag hitting the bottom of a cup</strong> — “A soft thump of purpose,” says
            Grogan.</li>
          <li><strong>The distant honk of a confused goose at 3 a.m.</strong> — “Existential. Possibly biographical.”
          </li>
          <li><strong>The slurp of a reluctant boot emerging from a peat bog</strong> — “Brogan calls it ‘rural
            applause.’”</li>
          <li><strong>Ice cracking in a glass during an argument</strong> — “A domestic plot twist,” Grogan notes.</li>
          <li><strong>The accidental whistle your nose makes when you're pretending to be asleep</strong> — “Proof the
            body has opinions.”</li>
          <li><strong>The wet slap of a fish against a table in Wexford</strong> — “More emotional than it sounds.”</li>
          <li><strong>The echo of “Sorry” shouted into an empty cathedral</strong> — “Brogan tried it once. Still
            waiting to hear it come back.”</li>
          <li><strong>The squeak of a supermarket trolley that only turns left</strong> — “A tragic metaphor, if you
            listen closely.”</li>
          <li><strong>The startled intake of breath when someone realises they’ve been holding it since 1998</strong> —
            “Common during therapy and plumbing.”</li>
          <li><strong>The faint, inexplicable creak in a perfectly still house</strong> — “Grogan insists it’s just
            wood. Brogan suspects it’s remorse.”</li>
        </ol>

        <p>“The world doesn’t lack music,” says Grogan. “It just hides it in strange places.”</p>

        <p>“And some of the finest compositions,” adds Brogan, “require no instrument but a life lived oddly.”</p>

      <h2>Grogan &amp; Brogan on the Funniest Eavesdropping Stories They Have Ever Heard</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 4 June 2025</p>
      <p>“We don’t spy,” says Grogan. “We simply tune into passing broadcasts of human confusion.” Brogan agrees. “A
        café is just a theatre with coffee and worse acoustics.”</p>

      <img src="assets/grogan-eavesdrop-small.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan eavesdropping politely" class="blog-image"

      <span id="entry29" style="display:none;">
        <p>👂 <em>“If people didn’t want to be overheard,” says Brogan, “they wouldn’t speak in perfect punchlines while
            standing next to me.”</em></p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>The Breakup at Table 9:</strong> “I’m not saying you’re emotionally distant, Mark — I’m just
            saying I know more about the barista than I do about your dreams.” (Grogan applauded softly.)</li>

          <li><strong>Philosophy in the Laundrette:</strong> “If socks have souls, then where do the missing ones go?”
            “Probably France.”</li>

          <li><strong>The Grandmother on the Train:</strong> “He says he’s a minimalist now, but I saw four different
            types of chutney in his fridge. Minimalism my arse.”</li>

          <li><strong>The Toddler at the Butcher’s:</strong> “Mummy says that piggies make bacon, but I saw Peppa Pig
            and she was nice.”</li>

          <li><strong>The Nervous First Date:</strong> “Technically, I live with my parents. But spiritually, I inhabit
            a lighthouse of personal growth.”</li>

          <li><strong>The Disgruntled Dog Owner:</strong> “I wanted a companion. I got a hairy anarchist with boundary
            issues.”</li>

          <li><strong>The Hairdresser’s Confession:</strong> “I sometimes give people ‘accidental bangs’ if they’ve been
            rude. But I call it fate.”</li>

          <li><strong>The Man in the Queue:</strong> “If this is fast food, I’m a cucumber.”</li>

          <li><strong>The Woman with the Loud Phone Call:</strong> “I told him I’m emotionally available but I wasn’t
            available emotionally at the time. That’s not hypocrisy — that’s logistics.”</li>

          <li><strong>Brogan’s Favourite (overheard by Grogan):</strong> “If you must leave me, do it like a gentleman —
            in silence, via WhatsApp, and preferably during the credits.”</li>
        </ol>

        <p>“People are always more interesting when they forget they’re being listened to,” says Grogan.</p>
        <p>“Which is why we carry notebooks,” Brogan adds, “and a plausible expression of mild deafness.”</p>

      <h2>Grogan & Brogan on Misheard Lyrics That Changed Their Worldview</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 4 June 2025</p>
      <p>“Some people hear music,” says Grogan. “We hear questionable poetry buried under questionable diction.” Brogan
        adds: “Half of life is just confidently singing nonsense until someone corrects you — or joins in.”</p>

      <span id="entry30" style="display:none;">
        <p>🎶 <em>“I thought it was ‘Hold me closer, Tony Danza’ for twenty years,” says Brogan. “I still prefer
            it.”</em></p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>“Sweet dreams are made of cheese”</strong> — Grogan believed this for a decade. “It gave the song
            a whole new depth. I thought it was about lactose-based longing.”</li>

          <li><strong>“There’s a bathroom on the right”</strong> (actual: “There’s a bad moon on the rise”) — Brogan
            used it as travel advice for years. “It made Creedence very helpful.”</li>

          <li><strong>“I can see clearly now Lorraine has gone”</strong> — Grogan thought it was about a particularly
            disruptive woman. “I pictured overturned furniture.”</li>

          <li><strong>“Excuse me while I kiss this guy”</strong> — Brogan preferred it that way. “It added tenderness to
            Hendrix.”</li>

          <li><strong>“We built this city on sausage rolls”</strong> — “And why not?” Grogan demands. “It's the most
            plausible line they’ve ever written.”</li>

          <li><strong>“Don’t go, Jason Waterfalls”</strong> — Brogan was deeply moved by this personal appeal. “I
            imagined Jason as a misunderstood poet-plumber.”</li>

          <li><strong>“Every time you go away, you take a piece of meat with you”</strong> — “Romantic cannibalism,”
            Grogan explains. “It was the 80s.”</li>

          <li><strong>“I left my brains down in Africa”</strong> — “Fair,” Brogan shrugs. “It was a long trip.”</li>

          <li><strong>“It’s too late to order fries”</strong> (actual: “It’s too late to apologize”) — Grogan wept at
            this version. “Because it’s always too late.”</li>

          <li><strong>“No woman, no fries”</strong> — “This one,” Brogan insists, “changed everything I believe about
            both feminism and lunch.”</li>
        </ol>

        <p>“We never correct anyone anymore,” Grogan says. “What they think they heard is probably more meaningful.”</p>
        <p>“Mishearing,” Brogan concludes, “is the foundation of most religions and at least three of our friendships.”

    <!-- Blog 31 B&G on Grogan & Brogan contemplate nerdhood in Armenia -->

    <section class="blog-entry blog-post" data-category="history">
      <h2>Grogan &amp; Brogan on the Reality of Nerds and How They Are Perceived in Armenia</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 4 June 2025</p>
      <p>“A nerd,” says Grogan, “is just a poet who collects data.” Brogan adds: “In some countries that’s charming. In
        others, it’s grounds for mysterious respect.”</p>

      <img src="assets/grogan-nerds-armenia.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan contemplate nerdhood in Armenia"
        class="blog-image" style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry31" style="display:none;">
        <p>♟️ <em>“In Armenia,” Brogan notes, “nerds are not mocked — they are elected to things.”</em></p>

        <p>They were first alerted to the Armenian reverence for intellectualism when a twelve-year-old girl beat Brogan
          at chess using only one hand and no visible expression. “I felt seen,” he said. “Then humiliated. Then
          strangely proud.”</p>

        <p>Grogan insists that in Armenia, being a nerd is “not a social liability but a quiet superpower — like knowing
          the correct temperature for brewing black tea at altitude.”</p>

        <p>Brogan once attempted to explain Dungeons & Dragons to an Armenian librarian, who nodded and replied, “Ah, so
          it is a strategy for resolving psychological tension through controlled mythic structures.”</p>

        <p>They were invited to a poetry night in Yerevan, where the audience wore glasses *voluntarily*. “I felt
          intellectually underdressed,” Grogan confessed. “I only brought three metaphors.”</p>

        <p>“The real difference,” Brogan concludes, “is that in Armenia, nerds are romanticised. In Ireland, they’re
          mostly given nicknames and told to go outside.”</p>

        <p>So if you’re a nerd in need of a homeland, Grogan & Brogan suggest: go east. Bring a scarf. Know your
          Tolstoy. And maybe — just maybe — someone will call you a visionary instead of asking why you don’t play
          football.</p>

      <h2>Grogan &amp; Brogan on the Moment They Realised They Had Similar Sounding Names</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 4 June 2025</p>
      <p>“It took us years,” says Brogan. “We were too close to the vowels to see them.” Grogan nods. “Like two sheep in
        a fog — until one bleated the truth.”</p>

      <img src="assets/grogan-brogan-names.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan ponder their shared phonetics" class="blog-image"

      <span id="entry32" style="display:none;">
        <p>🔁 <em>“The realisation hit us mid-sentence,” Grogan says. “I was introducing him and realised I had just
            said my own name with a cold.”</em></p>

        <p>Brogan insists it wasn’t deliberate. “I genuinely thought I was the only -ogan in town. Then along comes
          Grogan with his assumptions and his ornamental teapot collection.”</p>

        <p>They briefly considered resolving the issue by one of them changing names. Grogan suggested ‘Steve.’ Brogan
          suggested ‘Groban.’ A standoff ensued.</p>

        <p>“It’s not the names themselves,” Grogan explains. “It’s the implications. People think we’re a law firm, or a
          tragic vaudeville duo.”</p>

        <p>They’ve endured years of postal mix-ups, mismatched monograms, and misattributed poetry. “He got thanked for
          my haiku about grief and margarine,” says Brogan. “It ruined my week.”</p>

        <p>Eventually, they embraced it. “We are phonetic twins,” Grogan declares. “Two ends of the same comedic
          accordion.”</p>

        <p>“Besides,” Brogan adds, “if you can’t tell us apart by now, perhaps we’re just your inner monologue having a
          cup of tea with itself.”</p>

      <h2>Grogan &amp; Brogan on Why Haircuts Are Often a Source of Confusion Amongst Their Fans</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 4 June 2025</p>
      <p>“The problem with identity,” says Grogan, “is that it’s often stored in the sideburns.” Brogan agrees: “The
        moment one of us trims a fringe, the other gets asked for directions in IKEA.”</p>

      <img src="assets/grogan-brogan-haircuts.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan after conflicting haircuts" class="blog-image"

      <span id="entry33" style="display:none;">
        <p>💇 <em>“At a gig in Doolin,” Brogan recalls, “a man shouted ‘Play the potato song!’ at Grogan for ten
            minutes. I had written it. But Grogan had the haircut.”</em></p>

        <p>They once tried getting the same trim “to unify the brand.” The result: chaos. “We were mistaken for a
          musical hedge fund,” Grogan muttered. “Or twins in mourning.”</p>

        <p>Fans rely heavily on visual shorthand. Grogan is “the one with the wind-swept look of poetic trauma.” Brogan
          is “the tidy one who might also do your taxes.”</p>

        <p>“But when Brogan gets a fade,” Grogan laments, “I’m suddenly the chaotic one. Which is confusing because I am
          — but I prefer to earn that reputation, not inherit it follicularly.”</p>

        <p>They tried subtle markers: different hats, a symbolic earring, a scarf that says *“I’m Grogan, probably.”*
          None of it helped. “People look at the hair,” Brogan says. “They trust the hair.”</p>

        <p>Now, before any public appearance, they coordinate trims. “Not to match,” Grogan insists. “Just to avoid
          emotional whiplash.”</p>

        <p>So if you’re ever unsure who’s who — don’t rely on the fringe. Listen to the sighs. Count the metaphors. Or
          just wait: one of them will inevitably mention a donkey.</p>

      <h2>Grogan &amp; Brogan on Conflicts Between Grogan &amp; Brogan</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 4 June 2025</p>
      <p>“We never fight,” Grogan insists. “We engage in prolonged thematic divergence.” Brogan disagrees. “We fight.
        But we do it like gentlemen — with metaphors and bad posture.”</p>

      <img src="assets/grogan-brogan-arguing.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan mid-disagreement" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry165" style="display:none;">
        <p>⚔️ <em>“There was once a three-day silence over whether the word ‘lilt’ could be used in a ballad about a
            drowning,” says Brogan. “I stand by the pause.”</em></p>

        <p>Their conflicts are rarely loud — but often operatic in tone. “It’s less shouting,” Grogan explains, “and
          more prolonged sighing across a field.”</p>

        <p>Topics of dispute include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Whether melancholy has a tempo.</li>
          <li>How many donkeys can be referenced in a single album.</li>
          <li>Who actually wrote “The Ballad of Margaret’s Elbow.”</li>
          <li>The correct emotional tone for the word ‘jam.’</li>
        </ul>

        <p>They once stopped speaking for a week over a harmonium. “I thought it was out of tune,” Grogan says. “Brogan
          thought I was out of touch.”</p>

        <p>Resolution usually comes through toast, or a walk in mist. “Sometimes,” Brogan says, “we just hear a robin
          and forget what we were arguing about.”</p>

        <p>They agree that conflict, handled right, is a form of editing. “I sharpen his sentimentality,” Grogan says.
          “And I soften his rage,” Brogan replies.</p>

        <p>So yes, they disagree. Often. But always in service of the same thing: the song, the friendship, and the
          shared belief that there is nothing more sacred than a line delivered with conviction — even if it’s about
          chutney.</p>

    <!-- Blog 35 B&G on Snail Racing-->

    <section class="blog-entry blog-post" data-category="sports">
      <h2>Grogan & Brogan on Snail Racing</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 2 June 2025</p>
      <p>Some say sport is about speed. Grogan says: only if you misunderstand time itself. “True racing,” he claims,
        “is the art of almost arriving.”</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-snail-small.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan on Snail Racing" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry35" style="display:none;">
        <p>🐌 <em>"You don’t race a snail. You accompany it. Like grief. Or certain types of cheese.”</em> — Grogan</p>

        <p>Brogan runs a semi-annual event in West Clare called the <strong>Mollusk Grand Prix</strong>. Entry is free,
          unless your snail has a sponsorship deal, in which case there’s a poetry surcharge.</p>

        <p>His champion, “Lightning O’Leary,” once took three days to finish the course — not due to fatigue but because
          he stopped to admire a dandelion. Brogan claims it was a form of protest.</p>

        <p>Grogan distrusts the whole enterprise. “Snails,” he says, “have nothing to prove. They’re Zen monks with
          slime trails.” He once tried to train one, but it kept crawling toward his copy of *Ulysses* and refusing to
          move.</p>

        <p>Brogan insists on custom jerseys. One year he stitched ‘Go Fast, Take Naps’ onto silk using a thimble, a
          rosary, and what he claims was divine guidance. The snail refused to wear it and ate the hem.</p>

        <p>Their biggest dispute came when Grogan entered a rock and claimed it was “a retired snail.” Brogan
          disqualified him on aesthetic grounds, citing Rule 4B: “All racers must express at least the illusion of
          forward motion.”</p>

        <p>Despite the arguments, they agree on this: watching snails race is good for the soul. It forces you to pause.
          To breathe. To rethink velocity. To admit that sometimes the finish line is just a socially acceptable excuse
          to begin again.</p>

        <p>So here’s to snail racing. The slowest rebellion. The quietest sport. The only contest where losing with
          style is considered a philosophical victory.</p>

      <h2>Grogan & Brogan on Bisous</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 2 June 2025</p>
      <p>They say every culture has its customs. Grogan says: some just involve more cheek contact. “The French invented
        bisous,” he claims, “to confuse the Irish and delay trains.”</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-bisous-small.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan on Bisous" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry36" style="display:none;">
        <p>💋 <em>“A kiss on each cheek is not affection. It’s bureaucracy.”</em> — Grogan</p>

        <p>Brogan once got caught in a five-bisous chain in a village near Lyon. “I lost two hours and all sense of
          identity,” he recalls. “By the third cheek, I was speaking Occitan.”</p>

        <p>Grogan prefers the Irish system. “A nod, a grunt, and a vague gesture toward tea. No physical contact, no
          emotional commitment. Just the way Saint Patrick intended.”</p>

        <p>They once tested their own greeting system — two air fiddles and a synchronized sigh — but it failed to catch
          on outside Ennistymon. “People thought we were haunted,” said Brogan.</p>

        <p>Grogan maintains that bisous are a form of surveillance. “Each kiss is a data point. By the fourth one,
          they’ve mapped your emotional topography and taxed your inner child.”</p>

        <p>Brogan disagrees. He sees bisous as currency. “Three in Paris, four in Nice, five in Corsica — it’s a form of
          regional inflation.” He once tried to pay for lunch with a well-placed peck. The waiter was unmoved.</p>

        <p>Despite cultural confusion, they agree: bisous are an art form. A choreography of the face. A socially
          mandated intimacy that dances the line between charm and terror.</p>

        <p>So here’s to the bisous. The kiss without commitment. The ritual without resolution. The only form of
          affection that might come with a weather warning and a regional map.</p>

      <h2>Grogan und Brotman on Bread</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 2 June 2025</p>
      <p>They say bread is the staff of life. Grogan says: only if you’re leaning on it during an existential crisis.
        Brotman disagrees. “Bread is not a staff,” he says, “it is a companion. A crusty, unpredictable companion.”</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-bread-small.jpg" alt="Grogan und Brotman on Bread" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry37" style="display:none;">
        <p>🍞 <em>“In Ireland, bread is judged by how well it soaks up sorrow. In Germany, by whether it could survive a
            siege.”</em> — Grogan</p>

        <p>Brotman grew up on loaves so dense they had diplomatic immunity. “It wasn’t bread,” Grogan once said, “it was
          a philosophy in a crust.”</p>

        <p>Grogan prefers soda bread. “You make it in a panic with leftover bits and blind hope — like most Irish
          decisions.” He once baked a loaf using only tea, salt, and a blessing from his aunt. It tasted like history
          and regret.</p>

        <p>Brotman calls Irish bread “emotionally porous.” He prefers rye: “dark, unsentimental, and heavy enough to
          flatten dissent.”</p>

        <p>They once entered a bake-off together. Grogan’s loaf collapsed under the weight of its own sentiment.
          Brotman’s broke the table. The judges wept — partly from hunger, partly from fear.</p>

        <p>Grogan believes bread should be eaten with hands, jam, and melancholy. Brotman brings a bread knife “out of
          respect.” He wears an apron with the phrase “Knead. Rise. Overthrow.”</p>

        <p>Despite divergent tastes, they agree: good bread contains time. It remembers heat and patience. And it speaks
          — not loudly, but with crumbs, crust, and the smell of a Saturday long gone.</p>

        <p>So here’s to the bread. Leavened or flat, tender or tyrannical. The edible history of humanity — sliced,
          shared, and slightly burnt.</p>

    <!-- Blog 38 Grogan & Brogan on Neanderthals -->
    <section class="blog-entry blog-post" data-category="history">
      <h2>Grogan & Brogan on Neanderthals</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 2 June 2025</p>
      <p>They say modern humans share 2% of their DNA with Neanderthals. Grogan says: “Only 2%? Then who’s been writing
        my love letters and hiding my shoes?”</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-neanderthal-small.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan on Neanderthals" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry38" style="display:none;">
        <p>🦴 <em>"I don’t mind being part Neanderthal," said Brogan, "but I’d like to know which part. If it’s the
            knees, that would explain the noise."</em></p>

        <p>Grogan once spat into a genealogy kit and received an email that simply read: “Good luck.” He framed it as
          proof of ancestral ambiguity.</p>

        <p>Brogan believes his inner Neanderthal is responsible for his fondness for damp caves, cooked meat, and
          defensive sulking. “They weren’t simple,” he insists. “They were just early.”</p>

        <p>Grogan disagrees. “I’m not descended from Neanderthals. I’m descended from a long line of unpaid poets and
          suspicious-looking cattle dealers.”</p>

        <p>They once spent a weekend in a Stone Age replica hut in Mayo. Brogan loved it. Grogan asked to go home after
          six minutes, citing a lack of existential privacy and the smell of burnt moss.</p>

        <p>Despite their DNA dispute, they agree on one thing: Neanderthals had the right idea. No social media, no
          spreadsheets, and the only form of therapy was howling at a full moon.</p>

        <p>So here’s to the Neanderthals. Misunderstood cousins. Champions of bone tools and poor lighting. Proof that
          you don’t need a chin to have an opinion — just a stick, a grunt, and a deeply questionable haircut.</p>

      <h2>Grogan & Brogan on Mediocre Soap Operas</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 2 June 2025</p>
      <p>They say art imitates life. Grogan says: only if life involves six marriages, three fake deaths, and a
        suspiciously fast-moving pregnancy. “Soap operas,” he claims, “are what happens when storytelling forgets to
        take its medication.”</p>
      <img src="assets/grogan-soap-small.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan on Soap Operas" class="blog-image"
        style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

      <span id="entry57" style="display:none;">
        <p>📺 <em>“A mediocre soap is like weak tea: disappointing, but you’ll still drink it if it’s raining.”</em> —
          Grogan</p>

        <p>Brogan is addicted to *Harbour Hearts*, a long-running saga set in a port town where no one has ever
          successfully parked a boat. “It’s not about quality,” he says. “It’s about emotional stamina.”</p>

        <p>Grogan tried watching once. “In episode 241,” he recalls, “a man fell into a coma, woke up fluent in Italian,
          then proposed to his brother’s fiancée with a cursed emerald. I needed a lie-down and two boiled eggs.”</p>

        <p>Brogan argues that soaps are myth-making. “They’re the Homeric epics of the mildly bored.” He once missed a
          funeral to catch the mid-season cliffhanger. “She came back from the dead — wearing heels.”</p>

        <p>Grogan believes mediocre soaps are public service warnings. “They teach us the value of silence, books, and
          walking outdoors.”</p>

        <p>They once pitched their own Irish soap: *Bogwater* — set in a rural village where the main conflict was
          whether the post office should sell falafel. RTÉ declined.</p>

        <p>Still, they agree: mediocre soaps offer comfort. Predictable chaos. Emotional weather you can see coming from
          miles off. They are the stew of the screen — occasionally lumpy, but warm, familiar, and strangely nourishing.
        </p>

        <p>So here’s to the soaps. The slow-burning train wrecks. The eternal Tuesdays. The tears, betrayals, and
          amnesia — brought to you by the same five actors and a haunted violin loop.</p>

  <h2>Grogan & Brogan on Brotman</h2>
  <p class="date">Posted on 2 June 2025</p>
  <p>They say three’s a crowd. Grogan says: only if the third one starts fermenting rye in your sock drawer. “Brotman is a concept,” he insists, “not a person.”</p>
  <img src="assets/grogan-brotman-small.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan on Brotman" class="blog-image" style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

  <span id="entry40" style="display:none;">
    <p>🥖 <em>“He arrived with a crust and no explanation.”</em> — Brogan</p>

    <p>Brotman appeared sometime between the Clonakilty Bean Festival and a misunderstanding involving sourdough diplomacy. No one remembers inviting him. He brought his own bench.</p>

    <p>Grogan remains sceptical. “I’ve never seen him blink,” he says. “Once he stared at a loaf until it developed a political opinion.”</p>

    <p>Brogan admires his discipline. “He weighs his thoughts. And his butter.” They once debated poetry for seven hours. Brotman won by refusing to speak.</p>

    <p>He claims to have no phone, no doorbell, and no need for closure. When he writes, he uses charcoal and a breadboard. “Ink is too fluid,” he once muttered. “I prefer crumbs.”</p>

    <p>Grogan suspects Brotman is part German philosopher, part rural hallucination. “He once asked me if my shadow had a backup plan.”</p>

    <p>Despite their doubts, they agree: the world needs at least one Brotman. Someone who takes bread seriously, silence personally, and never rushes a metaphor.</p>

    <p>So here’s to Brotman. Mysterious third man. Fermenter of thought. The only one among them who can slice a pumpernickel with moral clarity and still leave room for jam.</p>

  <h2>Grogan & Brogan on Their Song "England"</h2>
  <p class="date">Posted on 2 June 2025</p>
  <p>They say songwriting is therapy. Grogan says: only if your therapist carries a tin whistle and unresolved colonial grievances. “England,” he claims, “isn’t a song. It’s a diagnosis.”</p>
  <img src="assets/grogan-england-small.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan on Their Song 'England'" class="blog-image" style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

  <span id="entry41" style="display:none;">
    <p>🎤 <em>“It’s not about England. It’s about everything we buried there.”</em> — Brogan</p>

    <p>Grogan insists the song came to him in a dream involving a Morris dancer, an unpaid electricity bill, and the ghost of Wolfe Tone sipping gin. “I woke up humming betrayal in D minor,” he said.</p>

    <p>Brogan maintains it’s not anti-English. “It’s just pro-complication.” He tried to soften one verse by adding a line about warm beer and polite regret, but Grogan removed it on spiritual grounds.</p>

    <p>They argue over the bridge. Grogan wanted spoken-word anguish. Brogan wanted a kazoo solo. The compromise was silence — but a very pointed silence.</p>

    <p>Listeners have called the song “harrowing,” “weirdly danceable,” and “too honest for a Tuesday.” One man in Leeds reportedly wept, then demanded the chords.</p>

    <p>They once performed it in a Camden pub. The fire alarm went off halfway through. Grogan called it divine commentary. Brogan finished the song while evacuating.</p>

    <p>Despite differing views, they agree: the song “England” is a lament disguised as a rant, or perhaps the other way round. A tune for exiles, dreamers, and anyone who’s ever queued for a visa with mixed emotions.</p>

    <p>So here’s to “England.” The bruised ballad. The homeland haunting. A song that begins with a sigh and ends with a smirk — just like their friendship.</p>

  <h2>Grogan & Brogan on Brogan’s Musical Sensibilities</h2>
  <p class="date">Posted on 2 June 2025</p>
  <p>They say music is the food of love. Grogan says: only if love is slightly off-key and has strong opinions about accordion use. “Brogan’s musical sensibilities,” he adds, “are best described as emotionally suspicious.”</p>
  <img src="assets/brogan-music-small.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan on Brogan’s Musical Sensibilities" class="blog-image" style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; margin: 1em 0;" />

  <span id="entry42" style="display:none;">
    <p>🎶 <em>“He has the soul of a fiddler, the ears of a sceptic, and the timing of a distracted goat.”</em> — Grogan</p>

    <p>Brogan claims to like “whatever is honest and poorly mixed.” His favourite genre is “live pub confusion.” He once described a chord progression as “too emotionally available.”</p>

    <p>Grogan believes Brogan’s true instrument is the heavy pause. “He can silence a room with a single hummed note — mostly by accident.”</p>

    <p>Brogan distrusts songs in major keys. “They’re hiding something,” he mutters. His ideal song includes three unresolved verses and a final chord that walks away before answering your question.</p>

    <p>They once collaborated on a sea shanty about taxation. Brogan added a fifth verse involving a corrupt customs officer and a haunted harmonium. Grogan hasn’t spoken of it since.</p>

    <p>At home, Brogan listens to recordings of rain on windows, mixed with distant sheep and church bells. “It’s not music,” he says. “It’s acoustic memory loss.”</p>

    <p>Despite disagreements, Grogan admits Brogan’s instincts are sound — in a way that defies commercial logic. “He can make a room cry with a spoon and a radiator. I respect that.”</p>

    <p>So here’s to Brogan’s musical sensibilities. Half folk, half philosophy, all feeling. The soundtrack of an awkward hug between memory and mischief.</p>
