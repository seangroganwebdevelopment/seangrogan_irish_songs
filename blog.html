      <h2>How I Met Brogan</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on 29 May 2025</p>
      <p>Memories of Brogan...</p>
      <span id="entry4" style="display:none;">
       <p>🎶 How I Met Brogan by Grogan</p>

        <p>I first met Brogan in a translation booth in Luxembourg. Yes — you read that right. Not at a pub session, not
          on a windswept Kerry road, not in the cell of a revolutionary monastery — but in a sterile European Union
          conference room where they were arguing about pig subsidies in seventeen languages.</p>
        <p>He leaned into his microphone and whispered, “This place needs a bodhrán.”</p>
        <p>I didn’t laugh. I wrote it down. That was the first line of the first song we ever wrote together. It was
          never released. We called it <em>“Ballad of the Bureaucrat’s Pig.”</em></p>
        <p>Brogan believed poetry belonged in places that didn’t want it. On roundabouts. In footnotes. In the gaps
          between tired words and missed chances. I think that’s why we got along.</p>
        <p>We came from opposite ends of the same bog:<br>
          He — musical instinct incarnate. A man who could coax melody from a radiator pipe and claimed his earliest
          influence was the sound of rain on a caravan roof.<br>
          Me — a compulsive scribbler. Raised on mass cards and protest songs, obsessed with rhyme, meter, myth, and
          mistakes.</p>
        <p>Together, we wrote. Songs about emigrants and eccentrics. Donkeys and industrial schoolboys. Priests who saw
          visions and women who saw through us. Some songs made people laugh. Some made them weep. A few did both in the
          same verse.</p>

        <p>We bickered, of course. He liked first takes. I liked revisions. He believed in chaos; I believed in
          craftsmanship. But the music found a way through. Always.</p>

        <p>Then one day, he disappeared.</p>

        <p>Not like in a dramatic movie. No farewell note. No tragic accident. Just... gone. His fiddle left behind. His
          boots still muddy. A cupboard full of scribbled half-verses and jars of pickled beets he insisted were good
          for “melodic tone.”</p>

        <p>For a while, I thought he’d faked his own death for publicity. Then I thought he’d gone feral and was living
          off-grid in Donegal, collaborating with seals. I still think that might be true.</p>

        <p>In the years since, I’ve kept writing. But the songs come differently now. Slower. More haunted. Like they’re
          trying to tell me something he forgot to say.</p>

        <p>Recently, I opened the old suitcase where we kept our lyrics — the Grogan & Brogan Songwriting Stash. Dozens
          of them. Some complete, some half-born, others written in languages neither of us spoke.</p>

        <p>And I thought: I can’t let this vanish.</p>

        <p>I’m nearly fifty. Too old for delusions, too young to give up. I want to publish the songs. Record them. Tour
          them across Ireland, Europe, and Africa — every place we ever dreamed aloud. Not for fame. Not even for
          closure.</p>

        <p>For Brogan.</p>

        <p>For the boy who opened his lunchbox to find a rodent and inspired a ballad.</p>

        <p>For the girl who heard <em>“Roses and Poitín”</em> and laughed through her tears.</p>

        <p>For Rainbow the donkey, who brayed on key.</p>

        <p>For the songs that keep arriving, unbidden and beautiful, like drunken angels.</p>

        <p>If you see Brogan — tell him the music’s waiting.</p>

        <p>Tell him I kept his boots.</p>

        <p>And tell him the gigs are starting soon.</p>

  <h2>Songs from the Stash — The Tour Begins</h2>
  <p class="date">Posted on May 29, 2025</p>
  <p><em>“Somewhere in a suitcase under my stairs, Brogan’s spirit was waiting.”</em> I never meant to go back on the road...</p>
    <span id="entry5" style="display:none;">

      <p>But something started stirring this year — a sense that time was no longer patient. That the songs Brogan and I wrote — scribbled on receipts, beer mats, and prayer cards — weren’t just memories. They were blueprints. Prophecies. Ghosts.</p>

      <p>So I opened the suitcase.</p>

      <p>Inside?<br>
      The Grogan & Brogan stash.</p>

      <p>Forty-seven songs we never released.<br>
      Twelve we only ever sang to donkeys.<br>
      Five written during a blackout in Ballymahone.<br>
      And one we swore we’d only perform “if the world started falling apart.”</p>

      <p><strong>Well… here we are.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>🎶 What Is Songs from the Stash?</strong><br>
      It’s not a greatest hits tour — because the world never gave us hits.<br>
      It’s not a comeback tour — because technically, we never went.</p>

      <p>It’s a celebration. Of exile, devotion, satire, and survival. Of stories that had no place until now. Of the absent presence of Brogan, wherever he is.</p>

      <p>Each night, I’ll open the suitcase and choose from:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>“Sleep Well Lads”</strong> — a lullaby for lost boys.</li>
        <li><strong>“Rodent in the Lunchbox”</strong> — a spoken-word scandal.</li>
        <li><strong>“The Drunken Paddy Reincarnated”</strong> — the gospel of glorious defiance.</li>
        <li><strong>“The Emigrant’s Regret”</strong> — love lost in the cold streets of Amerikay.</li>
        <li><strong>“Roses and Poitín”</strong> — a waltz for doomed romantics.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>And new songs — written for this tour, from the edge of fifty.</p>

      <p>There’ll be stories. Laughter. Silences you can feel. Maybe even a guest appearance from Rainbow the Donkey (if she cooperates).</p>

      <p><strong>📍 Where Are We Going?</strong><br>
      Everywhere we weren’t invited to in the first place:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Rural halls in Mayo, Cork, and Donegal</li>
        <li>Community theatres in Luxembourg, Berlin, and Brussels</li>
        <li>Courtyards in Cape Town and Harare</li>
        <li>A poetry shed in Kilfenora</li>
        <li>And a donkey sanctuary that’s “reviewing our request”</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>💬 Why Now?</strong><br>
      Because I’m nearly fifty.<br>
      Because the songs are ready.<br>
      Because Brogan would never forgive me if I didn’t.</p>

      <h2>The Power of the Ballad</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on May 1, 2025</p>
      <p>Irish ballads are more than just songs; they are oral history...
        <span id="entry1" style="display:none;">
          storytelling, and community wrapped into a single melody. When I write, I often find myself balancing the line
          between nostalgia and critique, honoring tradition while pushing its boundaries. The ballad's simplicity is
          deceptive—behind the melody lies a complexity that speaks to the human condition.

      <h2>Finding My Voice: An Afro-Irish Journey</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on May 8, 2025</p>
      <p>Being Afro-Irish means existing between worlds...
        <span id="entry2" style="display:none;">
          and it took me a long time to see that as a strength rather than a conflict. Growing up with Irish roots in a
          South African context shaped how I interpret both cultures. There’s a pulse to Irish folk that resonates with
          African rhythm—an organic, almost conversational cadence that makes sense when you live between these
          identities.

      <h2>Why Humor Matters in Folk Music</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on May 15, 2025</p>
      <p>One thing I love about Irish folk music is its ability to make you laugh...
        <span id="entry3" style="display:none;">
          while breaking your heart. Humor, to me, is not just a way of coping but a way of telling the truth without
          becoming preachy or self-important. When I write a satirical song, I'm not just aiming for a punchline—I'm
          trying to reveal something deeper about human nature.
