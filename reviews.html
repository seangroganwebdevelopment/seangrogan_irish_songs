  <h2>Grogan Reviews “The Snakes of Ireland”</h2>
  <p class="date">Posted on 1 June 2025</p>
  <p>The manuscript was found rolled in sheep wool, buried in an oil-drum in a Conamara cow shed. Its author, Pat O’Sullivan, remains unknown, unpublished, and possibly mythical. Naturally, Grogan couldn’t resist.</p>

    <p>📚 <em>“It reads like Flann O’Brien joined a cult and took a vow of venom.”</em> — Grogan</p>

    <p>*The Snakes of Ireland* is not a novel. It is an affliction. A manuscript that curses the hands that open it and hisses between its pages. Its plot — if that’s what you can call a spiralling series of visions involving a defrocked priest, a mute fiddler, and a talking eel named Séamas — defies summary. But Grogan tried anyway.</p>

    <p>The story begins in a flooded bog. Or a burned abbey. Or a Westport pub — depending on which page you start with. The narrator (possibly dead) guides us through a surreal version of Ireland where the snakes never left, they just learned Irish and joined the civil service.</p>

    <p>Each chapter reads like a different curse: poetic, unpredictable, and worryingly specific. One page is a Hiberno-English sonnet. The next, a pub receipt annotated with blood. There is no ISBN. There is no punctuation on Tuesdays.</p>

    <p>And yet, it is glorious. Strange, maddening, and unmistakably Irish. O’Sullivan — if he exists — writes with the venom of a man bitten too many times by history, myth, and public broadcasting. His characters are saints, drunks, and failed revolutionaries, often in the same body.</p>

    <p>Brogan called it “unreadable, therefore brilliant.” Grogan insists it is “an act of national exorcism disguised as folklore.” They both agree: it deserves no prize, and every shelf.</p>

    <p>If *Ulysses* was written for Bloomsday, *The Snakes of Ireland* was written for Lámh Láidir Day — the secret, unsanctioned feast of chaos where banshees recite poetry and priests spontaneously combust.</p>

    <p>And when Grogan finished it (by firelight, in a thunderstorm, drinking diluted holy water), he whispered, “It’s not a book. It’s a prophecy. And we’re already in chapter six.”</p>
