  <h2>🎻 The Ballad of the Unwritten Song</h2>
  <h3>A Grogan & Brogan Short Story</h3>

  <img src="assets/unwritten-song-small.jpg" alt="Grogan & Brogan writing music in a pub" class="story-image">

  <!-- Visible excerpt -->
  <p>The rain hadn’t let up for three days in Clifden, and the pub windows sweated harder than the men inside. A slow session simmered by the fire — fiddle, whistle, the odd guitar — but in the back corner, two men huddled in what looked more like a crisis summit than a jam.</p>
  <p>Grogan, all bone and wiriness, jabbed a biro at a sheet of paper.</p>
  <p>“No, no, no, Brogan — it’s ‘the donkey brayed thrice,’ not twice. The whole rhythm falls apart otherwise.”</p>

  <!-- Hidden full content -->
  <div id="unwritten-story-full" style="display: none;">
    <p>Brogan, whose long fingers were trying to coax a minor seventh out of a pint glass, didn’t look up.</p>
    <p>“I don’t care if the donkey brayed forty times. The melody’s in G sharp minor and that’s a sacred key for divine confusion. Just trust the sound, Hagar.”</p>
    <p>Grogan snorted. “Divine confusion? You’re confusing, I’ll grant you that.”</p>
    <p>The waitress — Maire, or maybe Máiread — set down their fifth Guinnesses with the weary grace of someone who'd seen poets drunk on worse ideas.</p>
    <p>“You two writing the Ballad of the Dying Sandwich again?”</p>
    <p>Brogan grinned. “Actually, it’s the Elegy for Claude the Donkey. Bit of a spiritual sequel.”</p>
    <p>She just shook her head. “I’ll bring you toast.”</p>
    <p>Grogan watched her go, then leaned back.</p>
    <p>“You know, we haven’t finished a song in six months.”</p>
    <p>“That’s not true,” Brogan said. “We ended one in Doolin in February. The one about the priest who boxed angels for sport.”</p>
    <p>Grogan rolled his eyes. “That was a haiku, Brogan. A haiku. We’re balladeers, not minimalist monks.”</p>
    <p>Brogan took a slow sip. “Maybe we’re evolving.”</p>
    <p>“Or devolving.”</p>
    <p>Then, silence. The session in the front room launched into “The Parting Glass.” Grogan stared at his lyrics. Brogan hummed along, half-remembered harmonies flitting between his ears.</p>
    <p>After a long moment, Grogan spoke, softer now.</p>
    <p>“You know, sometimes I wonder if we’ve already written our best song. That maybe the words are gone.”</p>
    <p>Brogan looked at him, really looked.</p>
    <p>“The words aren’t gone, Hagar. They’re just asleep. Like us. This isn’t a drought. It’s a Sabbath.”</p>
    <p>Grogan blinked. “A Sabbath?”</p>
    <p>“Aye. A holy rest for the soul. And when it ends,” he tapped the side of his temple, “there’ll be floods.”</p>
    <p>A pause.</p>
    <p>Then Grogan grinned, slow and crooked.</p>
    <p>“I suppose we’d better buy an ark.”</p>
    <p>Brogan lifted his glass. “Or at least another round.”</p>
    <p>They clinked pints.</p>
    <p>Outside, the rain stopped.</p>
    <p>And in the air, almost imperceptibly, a melody began to stir — one that hadn’t yet found its words.</p>

  <h2>🌈 Rainbow, Muse of the West</h2>
  <h3>A Grogan & Brogan Short Story</h3>

  <img src="assets/rainbow-story-small.jpg" alt="Grogan, Brogan, and Rainbow the donkey" class="story-image">

  <!-- Visible excerpt -->
  <p>It began with a bet in a pub in Letterfrack.</p>
  <p>Grogan was arguing, as usual, that inspiration came from the dead: famine ghosts, vanished kingdoms, the lost sons of Erin. Brogan disagreed — also as usual.</p>
  <p>“No, Hagar,” he said, slapping his pint down. “The muse is alive. Has teeth. Eats hay.”</p>

  <!-- Hidden full content -->
  <div id="rainbow-story-full" style="display: none;">
    <p>“You’re talking shite.”</p>
    <p>“I’m talking about Rainbow.”</p>
    <p>Grogan blinked. “You mean the donkey?”</p>
    <p>“She’s not just a donkey. She’s the donkey.”</p>
    <p>“Brogan, she bit me.”</p>
    <p>“That was affection. You misunderstand women.”</p>
    <p>That was Tuesday. By Friday, they had rented a shed near Cleggan and moved in with the donkey.</p>
    <p>Her name was Rainbow because Brogan claimed she farted in seven tones. Grogan maintained that was a lie, but couldn’t deny she had presence: a proud Connemara beast with a crooked tail and a gaze that said, “You may own guitars, but I have survived storms.”</p>
    <p>Every morning, they wrote verses to her. She refused to acknowledge them.</p>
    <p>Brogan picked out melodies on a child’s melodica. Grogan recited poems about agricultural loss and divine braying. Rainbow chewed old newspaper and shat on a Bodhrán.</p>
    <p>Days passed. Nights passed. Locals grew suspicious.</p>
    <p>Then one morning — the mist still curled like pipe smoke on the ground — Grogan burst into the pub like a man possessed.</p>
    <p>“We’ve done it,” he shouted. “She spoke to us.”</p>
    <p>Brogan followed, looking dazed. “She kicked the guitar. In D minor. It’s… it’s a lament.”</p>
    <p>They performed it that night.</p>
    <p>🎵 “Dear God in heaven, may the donkeys be blessed…”<br>
       🎵 “There’s no rain on earth that can dampen my Rainbow…”</p>
    <p>There wasn’t a dry eye in the house. Or a dry floor — Rainbow had been let in as guest of honour and promptly relieved herself by the fireplace.</p>
    <p>That didn’t matter. What mattered was the song — a strange, tender ballad that mixed humour and devotion, written not about a donkey, but for one.</p>
    <p>It toured with them for years. Brogan would always introduce it with a bow to the East.</p>
    <p>“To Rainbow, the muse of the West,” he’d say, “who taught us that not all beauty sings. Some bray.”</p>
    <p>Grogan, still suspicious of donkeys in general, would add:</p>
    <p>“And whose bite still haunts my left buttock.”</p>
    <p>Rainbow lived to a grand old age, celebrated in song, respected by musicians, feared by postmen.</p>
    <p>And the song they wrote — “Rainbow” — remains a curious wonder in their canon: a hymn to loyalty, hardship, and the dignity of stubborn creatures.</p>
    <p>Some say the melody was never quite right. Others swear the bridge section was her idea.</p>
    <p>Grogan & Brogan never clarified. They just called her their co-writer.</p>

<!-- Story 3- The Disappearance of Grogan -->
<section class="letter short-story">
  <h2>🕯 The Disappearance of Grogan (and the Donkey Who Found Him)</h2>
  <h3>A Grogan & Brogan Short Story</h3>

  <img src="assets/disappearance-story-small.jpg" alt="Grogan, Brogan, and the donkey in the Burren" class="story-image">

  <!-- Excerpt -->
  <p>It happened during the Ballyvaughan Folk Festival — the year the stage collapsed, the soup turned, and a céilí dancer got possessed (mildly).</p>
  <p>Grogan had been in rare form: quoting Joyce in Finnish, reciting a thirty-eight verse poem to a tin of sardines. Then, after their midnight set — a haunting new arrangement of “The Gypsy Rover” featuring Rainbow on backing vocals (read: braying) — Grogan vanished.</p>
  <p>Brogan checked the pubs. The chip van. The confession box. Nothing.</p>

  <!-- Hidden full content -->
  <div id="disappearance-story-full" style="display: none;">
    <p>Some said he’d gone into the Burren to “commune with the limestone.” Others believed he’d finally become a ghost himself — sucked into one of his own laments.</p>
    <p>But Brogan knew better. He packed a crusty loaf, three boiled eggs, and Rainbow.</p>
    <p>“You’re the only one who can sniff him out,” he muttered.</p>
    <p>They set off at dawn, the donkey leading. By the second hour, Rainbow veered off the trail and refused to move. Brogan, cranky and cold, lay down beside her and cursed.</p>
    <p>That’s when he heard it.</p>
    <p>A voice — raw, cracked — floating from a fissure in the rock.</p>
    <p>“They say the sea is full of singing, but it’s the land that holds the pain…”</p>
    <p>Brogan scrambled down. And there, in a hollow hidden beneath hawthorn and stone, was Grogan — legs crossed, eyes wild, notebook balanced on a flat rock.</p>
    <p>“You absolute gobshite,” Brogan said. “What are you doing?”</p>
    <p>“I’m listening,” Grogan whispered. “There’s a poem in the grass. The worms are chanting. The limestone has grief.”</p>
    <p>“You haven’t eaten in two days.”</p>
    <p>“I had a communion wafer from a Dutch backpacker.”</p>
    <p>At that moment, Rainbow let out a bellow so resonant the stone seemed to echo it back. Grogan froze. Then slowly, reverently, he wrote:</p>
    <p>“The donkey brays where poets fear to go — a voice both rude and radiant.”</p>
    <p>“That’s the chorus,” he said.</p>
    <p>Brogan blinked. “You mad bastard. That’s the chorus.”</p>
    <p>They walked back to town in silence, the donkey trotting ahead like a guide from another world.</p>
    <p>That night, the festival resumed. Brogan and Grogan played a new song — part prophecy, part comedy — about a donkey leading a man back from the brink of lyrical madness.</p>
    <p>They called it “Bray of the Forgotten Poet.”</p>
    <p>When they reached the line “And if I ever go missing again, just ask the donkey where I am,” Rainbow gave a mighty snort that brought the house down.</p>
    <p>The story passed into legend. Some said Grogan had gone mad in the Burren. Others that he’d simply needed a collaborator with more common sense than Brogan.</p>
    <p>Either way, from that day on, Grogan never wandered too far without Rainbow.</p>
    <p>And Brogan? He never questioned the donkey’s instincts again.</p>

<!-- Story 4- Sleep Well Lads -->
<section class="letter short-story">
  <h2>🕯 The Wake by the Stone Wall</h2>
  <h3>A Grogan Story, Inspired by “Sleep Well Lads”</h3>

  <img src="assets/SleepWellLads.png" alt="Grogan sitting by the stone wall at dusk" class="story-image">

  <!-- Visible excerpt -->
  <p>They came one by one to the old stone wall — not by invitation, but instinct.</p>
  <p>Brogan had seen the notice in the Connacht Tribune:</p>
  <p><em>Commemorative gathering for the unnamed boys of St. Dymphna’s Industrial School. Bring nothing but memory.</em></p>

  <!-- Hidden full content -->
  <div id="wake-story-full" style="display: none;">
    <p>Grogan hadn’t seen it. He had written it.</p>
    <p>He sat now on the lichen-slicked stone with a guitar across his knees and a battered notebook beside him. It was the first dry evening in a fortnight, and he had dressed like a man expecting rain anyway — scarf, coat, flask in pocket.</p>
    <p>Across the field, Brogan arrived with Rainbow in tow. The donkey had been painted with white flour-paste crosses, which Grogan wisely chose not to question.</p>
    <p>“You look like a prophet,” Brogan said, tying Rainbow to the kissing gate.</p>
    <p>Grogan looked up. “That’s funny. I feel like a gravedigger.”</p>
    <p>“You’re both. What’s the song?”</p>
    <p>Grogan handed over the notebook. Brogan scanned the refrain.</p>
    <p><em>Sleep well lads, we’ll see you on the other side,<br>When our tears are dried and everybody has cried…</em></p>
    <p>He nodded slowly. “You’ve done it again. Turned horror into lullaby.”</p>
    <p>“It’s not a song,” Grogan said. “It’s a wake.”</p>
    <p>Brogan looked around at the growing crowd — old men, young women, a child holding a candle in a jam jar.</p>
    <p>“No speeches,” Grogan said. “No anger tonight. Just names, and music.”</p>
    <p>They sang each verse for a boy without a headstone.</p>
    <p>One had died of pneumonia. One in a fire. One had “fallen” from the roof.</p>
    <p>The chorus came from everyone. The donkey brayed during the final line.</p>
    <p>And in the hush that followed, Grogan stood.</p>
    <p>“We’re not here to fix anything,” he said. “Only to remember what was broken. That’s the first stitch in the mending.”</p>
    <p>Rainbow let out a huff that fogged the night air.</p>
    <p>Brogan added, “She agrees.”</p>
    <p>They left nothing behind but candle wax, a few chords hanging in the wind, and a new name etched into the stone wall — not with chisel, but in chalk:</p>
    <p><strong>SLEEP WELL, LADS</strong></p>
    <p>Grogan never recorded the song. Said it wasn’t his to sell.</p>
    <p>But word spread. It found its way into village halls, into hushed church pews, into the mouths of those who had once been boys without lullabies.</p>
    <p>And from then on, Rainbow refused to walk past that field without stopping.</p>
    <p>Some said she was paying respects.</p>
    <p>Others said she just liked the silence there.</p>
    <p>Grogan said, “What’s the difference?”</p>

  <h2>🧳 The Letter to Agnes</h2>
  <h3>A Grogan Story, based on “England”</h3>

  <img src="assets/letter-to-agnes-small.jpg" alt="A woman reading a letter by a farm window" class="story-image">

  <!-- Visible excerpt -->
  <p>The letter was folded into eighths and smelled faintly of damp turf and tobacco. Agnes O’Shea found it in the pocket of an old peacoat, left behind in the upstairs room of the O’Driscoll farm where the workers used to board. She hadn’t opened that wardrobe in years.</p>
  <p>It was addressed, simply:</p>
  <p><em>“To Agnes, if you ever still think of me.”</em></p>

  <!-- Hidden full content -->
  <div id="agnes-story-full" style="display: none;">
    <p>She did. She always had.</p>
    <p><strong>Dear Agnes,</strong></p>
    <p>I’m writing this from the 8:15 ferry to Holyhead. The sea is steel grey. There’s a fella vomiting behind me and a baby wailing two rows up, and I thought — what better time to compose something for the only woman who ever got under my skin?</p>
    <p>By the time you read this, I’ll be in that godless land.</p>
    <p>Agnes sat down hard on the edge of the bed. The voice came off the page like mist off a river — ragged, real.</p>
    <p>I’m sorry for my weakness. I know money slipped through my hands like sheep on a wet hillside. I wasn’t a good man to you. But I never lied about one thing: I loved you. Still do. God help me.</p>
    <p>I’m going to my brother Patrick — yes, that Patrick — who lives in some post-industrial purgatory outside Birmingham. The kind of place where even the pigeons wear soot like a coat.</p>
    <p>Agnes smiled despite herself. Patrick Brogan. She remembered his red face and loud laugh and how he’d once tried to sell her a washing machine he’d found on the side of the road.</p>
    <p>There’s endless concrete and endless shouting. I’m bringing my shovel and my brogues and very little else. Maybe a photo of you, if it doesn’t fall out somewhere on the train.</p>
    <p>I’ll try to send money. I probably won’t. I’ll try to stay sober. I definitely won’t.</p>
    <p>But I’ll keep this promise: I’ll write you a song. Even if no one ever hears it. Even if I die in some bedsit choking on the smell of boiled cabbage and disappointment. You’ll have my song.</p>
    <p>That way, some part of me might get to stay with you.</p>
    <p><strong>Pray for me, Agnes.<br>And sleep well.<br>Yours in exile,<br>Sean Grogan</strong></p>
    <p>She read it again. And again.</p>
    <p>The song, she realised, had come. It was folded into every line, every apology, every ugly, beautiful truth. It wasn’t just a letter. It was <em>“England.”</em></p>
    <p>She went to the window and opened it. The wind was sharp and briny off Clew Bay. A curlew called once, then twice.</p>
    <p>Agnes pressed the letter to her chest.</p>
    <p>Then she picked up the phone and rang her niece.</p>
    <p>“Clare,” she said, “do you still have that tape recorder?”</p>
    <p>“Sure I do,” Clare replied. “What for?”</p>
    <p>“I’ve got a song I need to sing. And I want you to play it on the radio, like they do with those dedications.”</p>
    <p>“A love song?”</p>
    <p>“No,” said Agnes. “An exile’s confession.”</p>
    <p>And so it was that on a quiet Sunday night on a Mayo pirate radio station, between <em>The Fields of Athenry</em> and a tinny ABBA remix, came the cracked, haunting voice of Agnes O’Shea:</p>
    <p><em>England, O England, that godforsaken dive…<br>She takes in the lost souls of Ireland, while they are still alive…</em></p>

<!-- Story 6- The Power of the Child-->
 <section class="letter short-story">
  <h2>🕯 The Hollow Glen</h2>
  <h3>A Grogan & Brogan Short Story, based on “The Power of the Child Over Me”</h3>

  <img src="assets/hollow-glen-small.jpg" alt="Grogan and the boy in a misty glen" class="story-image">

  <!-- Visible excerpt -->
  <p>They had never played that song live.</p>
  <p>Not once.</p>
  <p>Not at Doolin. Not at Ballyshannon. Not even at the Olympia, where the crowd had begged for it by name. Grogan would just shake his head. Brogan would change the subject. And Rainbow the donkey, now half-retired and grazing in the fields beyond Clifden, would let out a soft, mournful bray, as if remembering something too.</p>

  <!-- Hidden full content -->
  <div id="hollow-story-full" style="display: none;">
    <p>The song existed on tape only. A single take. Grogan had wept halfway through. Brogan had left in the crack of the voice. “Honesty over harmony,” he’d said.</p>
    <p>That should have been the end of it.</p>
    <p>Until the boy came.</p>
    <p>He was about twelve. Showed up at their dressing room in Ennistymon with a fiddle case nearly as tall as himself and a letter from his mother.</p>
    <p>“He says your song saved his father. I’m not sure if it’s true. But it’s all he talks about. Would you let him play with you?”</p>
    <p>Grogan read the letter twice. Said nothing. Then walked out.</p>
    <p>Brogan nodded to the boy. “Can you play in D minor?”</p>
    <p>The boy smiled shyly. “I can play in sad.”</p>
    <p>They met Grogan the next morning, halfway up a glen outside town. He was sitting on a rock, staring into a hollow in the landscape where the mist never quite cleared.</p>
    <p>“I buried a child,” Grogan said, without turning. “Long before the songs. Long before the fame. I buried him right here.”</p>
    <p>Brogan put a hand on the boy’s shoulder. “Wait here.”</p>
    <p>He approached Grogan slowly, the way one might approach a wild animal or a grieving man.</p>
    <p>“I think the song needs to be played. Not for us. For him.”</p>
    <p>Grogan turned. His face was soft. “Then let the child lead it.”</p>
    <p>That night, in a packed church with candlelight flickering like heartbeat, they played “The Power of the Child Over Me.”</p>
    <p>Grogan whispered the verses, not sang them. Brogan underscored with gentle guitar.</p>
    <p>And when the boy raised his fiddle, the sound that came was not music — it was memory. It filled the rafters. It cut through time. It felt like a voice that had been missing from the song all along.</p>
    <p>People didn’t clap. They stood. Then wept.</p>
    <p>Later, the boy approached Grogan.</p>
    <p>“Who was he?” he asked.</p>
    <p>Grogan knelt down. “He was the reason I write. And the reason I stop. Thank you for letting him speak.”</p>
    <p>They never played the song again.</p>
    <p>They didn’t need to.</p>
    <p>The boy, they heard, went on to win the All-Ireland. But he never stopped telling people about the time he met a broken man and helped finish a lullaby for a lost son.</p>

<!-- Story 3- Drunken Paddy reincarnated-->
 <section class="letter short-story">
  <h2>🍷 The Gospel of the Bottle</h2>
  <h3>A Brogan-Led Tale, Based on “The Drunken Paddy Reincarnated”</h3>

  <img src="assets/gospel-bottle-small.jpg" alt="Brogan dressed as a barefoot prophet blessing pints" class="story-image">

  <!-- Visible excerpt -->
  <p>When Brogan declared himself the Second Coming of the Drunken Paddy, Grogan assumed it was another one of his seasonal breakdowns. The kind that followed long tours, too much porter, and the occasional run-in with the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
  <p>But this was different.</p>
  <p>He showed up to rehearsal barefoot, with a staff made of driftwood, wearing a bedsheet robe dyed with beetroot.</p>

  <!-- Hidden full content -->
  <div id="gospel-story-full" style="display: none;">
    <p>“Behold,” Brogan announced, “the Messiah has returned — born of Poitín and Psalm!”</p>
    <p>Grogan didn’t look up from his tea. “Did you borrow that robe from your auntie’s laundry line?”</p>
    <p>“No,” Brogan said solemnly. “It was gifted by the Spirits.”</p>
    <p>“You mean spirits as in ghosts or spirits as in alcohol?”</p>
    <p>“Yes.”</p>
    <p>The transformation was complete.</p>
    <p>He rewrote “Whiskey in the Jar” as a liturgical chant. He blessed strangers at bus stops with sprigs of bog myrtle. He took confessions in pub toilets — and always prescribed a pint and a song as penance.</p>
    <p>Word spread.</p>
    <p>In Galway, they started calling him Saint Brogan of the Back Bar.</p>
    <p>In Ennis, a woman claimed her rheumatism vanished after he sneezed on her pint.</p>
    <p>In Mullingar, he performed a miracle: turning flat lager into flat stout.</p>
    <p>Grogan had had enough.</p>
    <p>“You’re making a holy show of us,” he hissed backstage at the Listowel Folk Festival. “You’re not a reincarnated prophet. You’re a man in his forties with poor impulse control and a healthy disrespect for authority.”</p>
    <p>Brogan just smiled, beatific. “But Hagar, that’s exactly what the first Drunken Paddy was.”</p>
    <p>Then he pulled out the notebook. The new song was scrawled in ink and something that smelled like jam.</p>
    <p><em>I am the scion of a lineage of Paddies long,<br>
    Begot by whisky, made holy by song…</em></p>
    <p>It was blasphemy. It was poetry. It was Brogan.</p>
    <p>And Grogan — reluctantly, inevitably — began to hum a harmony.</p>
    <p>They premiered the song in Kilfenora, under a banner that read “Spirits High: A Festival of Divine Intoxication.”</p>
    <p>Brogan wore his robe. Grogan wore his best tweed and a grimace.</p>
    <p>The crowd sang the chorus as if their lives depended on it.</p>
    <p><em>Let him totter down the country lane,<br>
    And exercise his sacred gullet in the rain…</em></p>
    <p>At the last note, a bottle of Tullamore Dew appeared from nowhere and was passed forward like communion.</p>
    <p>Grogan took a sip.</p>
    <p>“I’ll admit it,” he said, coughing. “You’ve got something.”</p>
    <p>“I know,” Brogan said, eyes twinkling. “Faith.”</p>
    <p>They never toured the song abroad. It was deemed “too holy for export.”</p>
    <p>But in Ireland, it spread like wildfire — passed from mouths to pints to memory.</p>
    <p>And to this day, if you hear wild laughter on a stormy night, and a voice reciting beatitudes in iambic pentameter, it might just be Brogan…</p>
    <p>…still wandering the lanes, still slightly drunk, still preaching the gospel of the bottle.</p>

<!-- Story 3- The Day Jesus got Punched-->
<section class="letter short-story">
  <h2>⛪ The Day Jesus Got Punched</h2>
  <h3>A Grogan & Brogan Story, Based on “The Mad Priest of Ballynahinch”</h3>

  <img src="assets/jesus-punched-small.jpg" alt="Father Quinn at the altar of chaos" class="story-image">

  <!-- Visible excerpt -->
  <p>Ballynahinch had two constants: drizzle, and Father Jeremiah Quinn.</p>
  <p>Nobody could agree if the priest had lost his marbles or simply exchanged them for a higher set of visions. Either way, he was a fixture — shouting Latin into the river, blessing tractors, and once trying to exorcise a bodhrán player mid-jig.</p>
  <p>When Grogan & Brogan came to town, they intended to avoid him.</p>

  <!-- Hidden full content -->
  <div id="jesus-story-full" style="display: none;">
    <p>Until he invited them to Mass.</p>
    <p>“Bring instruments,” the letter read. “And an open mind.”</p>
    <p>Grogan groaned. “This smells like a trap.”</p>
    <p>Brogan grinned. “This smells like a song.”</p>
    <p>The altar was covered in turnips.</p>
    <p>“We honour the agricultural martyrs of old,” said Father Quinn. “Those who fell in battle against the Combine Harvester.”</p>
    <p>Grogan’s eyes widened. “He’s not well.”</p>
    <p>Brogan scribbled a verse in his notebook.</p>
    <p>Then the Mass began.</p>
    <p>Instead of the Eucharist, he served poitín in teacups and read from <em>Finnegans Wake</em>. At the homily, he addressed Jesus directly.</p>
    <p>“You’re late,” he said. “We’ve had six governments and three Garth Brooks concerts. Where were you?”</p>
    <p>Then he gestured toward Grogan.</p>
    <p>“You — the man with the sad eyebrows. Play something penitential.”</p>
    <p>Grogan muttered a curse and strummed an Em chord that somehow sounded like despair itself.</p>
    <p>“Louder!” the priest cried. “Make it weep for Ballynahinch!”</p>
    <p>Then came the incident.</p>
    <p>Midway through Brogan’s ballad about divine indigestion, Father Quinn stood, arms wide, and shouted, “I invite the Lord among us!”</p>
    <p>And a man — thin, pale, barefoot — walked in through the side door.</p>
    <p>He bore a striking resemblance to Jesus, if Jesus had lived on lentils and lived in Lahinch.</p>
    <p>“Hello,” he said. “I’m looking for the toilets.”</p>
    <p>The priest gasped. “It’s Him.”</p>
    <p>The man tried to protest, but it was too late — he was pulled to the front, seated beside the turnips, and handed a lamb bone.</p>
    <p>Father Quinn knelt. “What say you to the sins of this parish?”</p>
    <p>The man blinked. “Is this… a sketch show?”</p>
    <p>Then, with tragic inevitability, Father Quinn punched him in the jaw.</p>
    <p>Pandemonium followed. The choir screamed. Someone threw a hymnal. Rainbow, who had been tethered outside, kicked the vestry door open and brayed like the trumpet of Revelation.</p>
    <p>Grogan grabbed Brogan’s arm. “We’re leaving.”</p>
    <p>“Not yet,” Brogan said. “We haven’t finished the second verse.”</p>
    <p>They played “The Mad Priest of Ballynahinch” that very night, in a pub twenty miles away. It brought the house down.</p>
    <p>The refrain was unforgettable:</p>
    <p><em>Jesus tried to comfort him, but was instead punched right in the gob,<br>
    And the papal envoy kept chewing on a chicken kebab…</em></p>
    <p>Grogan raised his glass. “Here’s to Father Quinn. Ireland’s last true mystic.”</p>
    <p>Brogan nodded. “And to Jesus of Lahinch — may his jaw recover.”</p>
    <p>The priest was never seen again.</p>
    <p>Some say he was recalled to Rome. Others say he opened a chip van in Clonmel that only serves spiritual guidance and battered haddock.</p>
    <p>But Grogan & Brogan kept the story alive — a mad comedy of faith and fists, forever enshrined in song.</p>

<!-- Story 3- Lost at Sea-->
<section class="letter short-story">
  <h2>🌊 The Curragh That Never Returned</h2>
  <h3>A Grogan Story, Inspired by “Lost at Sea”</h3>

  <img src="assets/curragh-never-returned-small.jpg" alt="Driftwood and sea mist near Ballycroy" class="story-image">

  <!-- Visible excerpt -->
  <p>The bottle washed ashore in Ballycroy two weeks after the storm.</p>
  <p>An old man found it — combing the rocks for driftwood — and brought it to the pub like a relic. Inside was a scroll of waterproofed paper, curled like a sleeping child.</p>
  <p>Grogan happened to be there. He read it aloud without knowing why.</p>

  <!-- Hidden full content -->
  <div id="curragh-story-full" style="display: none;">
    <p>It was addressed, simply:<br><em>“To My Mother, if the sea should keep me.”</em></p>
    <p><strong>Dear Mother,</strong></p>
    <p>The tide’s turned cruel and I may not come home. I feel it in the way the gulls fly low and the water tastes more of iron than salt.</p>
    <p>I wanted to say this: I saw your face in the stars last night. And for a moment, I believed I was safe.</p>
    <p>Grogan’s voice cracked. The pub had gone still — not even a pint pulled. The wind rattled the door like an old soul trying to get in.</p>
    <p>We saw it coming at noon — a black wall, sudden and soundless. One lad swore it was a banshee’s curse. I told him that’s nonsense. But still, I held my rosary.</p>
    <p>Tell Father Doyle I prayed, not for forgiveness, but to see your hands again — flour-dusted, smoothing linen on the line.</p>
    <p>Outside, rain tapped at the windows like it had been listening all along.</p>
    <p>We followed the herring as far as the nets would let us, but the sea follows no map.</p>
    <p>One of the lads, a newlywed, sang a song to keep warm. I wanted to join him, but I was busy rowing us into the storm.</p>
    <p>Now the light’s gone strange. It’s either dawn, dusk, or neither.</p>
    <p>When Grogan looked up, he saw Brogan standing in the doorway. He hadn’t even known he was in town.</p>
    <p>Brogan nodded. “Keep going.”</p>
    <p>Grogan read the final lines softly:</p>
    <p><em>If I don’t come back, don’t blame the sea. She fed us longer than any government.</em></p>
    <p><em>Bury a piece of driftwood with my name carved in it. Sing me a song I’ll never hear. And tell the little ones that I sailed into the sun.</em></p>
    <p><strong>I am, as ever,<br>Your son.</strong></p>
    <p>The letter ended, but the song was just beginning.</p>
    <p>Grogan & Brogan played “Lost at Sea” that night — its melody slow and sure, like oars through fog.</p>
    <p>Rainbow brayed from outside the pub at just the right moment, as if mourning or agreeing — no one could tell.</p>
    <p>And when the last note fell, someone whispered, “That was his voice. The lad who never came home.”</p>
    <p>They never found the boat.</p>
    <p>But every year, when the tide is right, someone carves a name into driftwood and sets it floating out from Ballycroy.</p>
    <p>Sometimes a letter returns.</p>
    <p>Sometimes it doesn’t.</p>
    <p>But the song always does.</p>

<!-- Story 3- Pooh-->
<section class="letter short-story">
  <h2>🍯 The Ballad of Pooh MacDonagh</h2>
  <h3>A Grogan & Brogan Story, Based on “The Irish Winnie the Pooh”</h3>

  <img src="assets/pooh-macdonagh-small.jpg" alt="Pooh MacDonagh and friends in a Leitrim field" class="story-image">

  <!-- Visible excerpt -->
  <p>It began with a headline in <em>The Leitrim Echo</em>:<br>
  <strong>RURAL CLERGYMAN ACCUSES CARTOON BEAR OF HERESY</strong></p>
  <p>Brogan nearly choked on his porridge.</p>
  <p>Grogan, skimming the article, murmured: “Apparently the bear is living in a hollow tree behind the sacristy and giving out unsolicited advice.”</p>

  <!-- Hidden full content -->
  <div id="pooh-story-full" style="display: none;">
    <p>Brogan grinned. “Well then. We must go.”</p>
    <p>The tree was real. The bear was... debatable.</p>
    <p>He had a soft cork-accent and introduced himself as Pooh MacDonagh, philosopher, beekeeper, and “occasional advisor to disillusioned farmers.”</p>
    <p>His companions — a donkey called Oisín with deep abandonment issues, a hyperactive hare named Séamus, and a clinically anxious piglet called Peadar — were gathered around a stone circle when Grogan & Brogan arrived.</p>
    <p>“We were just discussing the Eucharist,” said Pooh, licking honey from a stick. “It’s a good concept but poorly marketed.”</p>
    <p>Brogan sat cross-legged. “Do go on.”</p>
    <p>Over tea (made by Peadar, who apologised after every pour), the bear laid out his beliefs.</p>
    <p>“Life,” he said, “is a field. The Church is a stone in the middle. You can rest on it or trip over it. The important thing is to walk barefoot.”</p>
    <p>Grogan scribbled that down.</p>
    <p>Séamus the hare added, “And the field is full of foxes. And turf inspectors. And cousins you owe money to.”</p>
    <p>“Especially that,” said Pooh solemnly.</p>
    <p>The priest arrived at dusk.</p>
    <p>Father Malloy, red-faced and sweating despite the cold, pointed at the bear.</p>
    <p>“You’re a menace! You’ve turned my parish into a petting zoo with opinions!”</p>
    <p>Pooh blinked. “I merely suggested that belief and doubt are both forms of hunger. Now would you like a scone?”</p>
    <p>The priest roared and kicked over the stone circle.</p>
    <p>That was when Oisín the donkey, previously silent, sighed and said: “I used to be an altar boy.”</p>
    <p>Nobody knew what it meant. But it silenced the whole meadow.</p>
    <p>Later, in the pub, Grogan and Brogan wrote the song in one sitting.</p>
    <p><strong>“The Irish Winnie the Pooh”</strong> became an underground hit — banned from diocesan radio, beloved in student bedsits.</p>
    <p><em>He reads the Book of Kells by moonlight,<br>
    And sings sean-nós to his bees,<br>
    He’s got theology and honey on his knees…</em></p>
    <p>The bear? He was never seen again.</p>
    <p>Some say he joined a commune in Roscommon. Others say he reincarnated as a marmalade-loving fox in Sligo.</p>
    <p>But Grogan & Brogan kept his wisdom alive in verses sung softly in smoky rooms:</p>
    <p><em>And if you find a bear in the bog, giving out softly to a frog,<br>
    Don’t run. Don’t judge. Just listen.<br>
    He might be your only true philosopher left.</em></p>

<!-- Story 3- Rodent in a Lunchbox-->

<section class="letter short-story">
  <h2>🧀 The Ballyloughlin Infestation Scandal</h2>
  <h3>A Grogan & Brogan Satirical Story, Based on “Rodent in the Lunchbox”</h3>

  <img src="assets/ballyloughlin-rodent-small.jpg" alt="Papier-mâché rodent in a school lunchbox scandal" class="story-image">

  <!-- Visible excerpt -->
  <p>It all started with a sandwich.</p>
  <p>Tuesday morning. St. Ursula’s National School. Little Declan O’Murchú opened his lunchbox to find, nestled between a squashed cheese string and a bruised banana...</p>
  <p>…a rodent.</p>

  <!-- Hidden full content -->
  <div id="ballyloughlin-story-full" style="display: none;">
    <p>Alive. Slightly damp. Holding a Cheerio like a sacred object.</p>
    <p>The teachers screamed. The headmaster fainted. A sixth-year filmed the whole thing and added techno music. It went viral before third period.</p>
    <p>Grogan & Brogan were booked for a songwriting residency in the area that week. Their brief was to teach harmony and hope.</p>
    <p>Instead, they wrote a five-minute newsreel-style ballad called <strong>“Rodent in the Lunchbox.”</strong></p>
    <p>It opened with a thunderclap. Then Brogan, deadpan:</p>
    <p><em>“This is RTÉ. Today we report on the horror unfolding in Ballyloughlin. Parents are furious. Children are traumatised. And the rodents… are organised.”</em></p>
    <p>Grogan provided ominous banjo tremolos.</p>
    <p>The chorus, if it could be called that, was a whispered chant:</p>
    <p><em>“Lunchbox. Cheese box. Pestilence and dread box…”</em></p>
    <p>It was deeply upsetting.</p>
    <p>The principal resigned.</p>
    <p>A week later, they staged a “reconstruction” in the schoolyard. Brogan wore a giant papier-mâché rodent head and delivered a monologue in iambic pentameter:</p>
    <p><em>“I did not ask for ham nor bread nor jam —<br>I sought but shelter from the monstrous Man.”</em></p>
    <p>The PTA issued a cease and desist.</p>
    <p>The rodent, they insisted, was an isolated incident. Probably a field mouse. Possibly imaginary.</p>
    <p>Grogan disagreed.</p>
    <p>“The mouse,” he told <em>The Irish Times</em>, “is a metaphor for the suppressed scream of Irish childhood.”</p>
    <p>The article ran with the headline:<br><strong>“Metaphor with Whiskers Causes Outrage.”</strong></p>
    <p>Months later, the ballad had taken on a life of its own. Students printed stickers. A punk band covered it. One performance art collective performed it entirely in interpretive dance using actual cheese.</p>
    <p>Grogan & Brogan refused to remove the song from their live sets.</p>
    <p>“Satire is sacred,” Grogan said.</p>
    <p>“Also,” Brogan added, “rodents are people too.”</p>
    <p>The real rodent? Never found.</p>
    <p>But to this day, in schoolyards across Connacht, lunchboxes are opened slowly, reverently.</p>
    <p>And sometimes, just sometimes…</p>
    <p><em>…a tiny whisper escapes.</em></p>
    <p><strong>“We are the cheese-born. We remember.”</strong></p>

<!-- Story 3- Socks from Dad-->

<section class="letter short-story">
  <h2>🧦 The Gift That Didn’t Fit</h2>
  <h3>A Grogan & Brogan Story, Based on “Socks from Dad”</h3>

  <img src="assets/socks-from-dad-small.jpg" alt="Maroon socks and Rainbow the donkey in festive gear" class="story-image">

  <!-- Visible excerpt -->
  <p>It was Christmas Eve in Castlebar. A grey slush coated the streets, and the pub smelled like regret and stale turkey crisps.</p>
  <p>Grogan was nursing a hot whiskey. Brogan had tied tinsel to Rainbow’s ears and was busking “The Wren Song” outside for coins and spiritual fulfilment.</p>
  <p>A man approached them — short, square-shouldered, with the haunted eyes of a man who’d read one too many self-help books.</p>

  <!-- Hidden full content -->
  <div id="socks-story-full" style="display: none;">
    <p>“Are ye the fellas who write those... musical confessionals?” he asked.</p>
    <p>Grogan nodded warily. “We are.”</p>
    <p>The man dropped a pair of socks onto the table. Maroon. Wool. Unworn.</p>
    <p>“I need a song,” he said.</p>
    <p>His name was Norris O’Sullivan, and the story poured out like supermarket brand sherry.</p>
    <p>He’d met a woman in Mayo, one wild October night, and sang her a love song in the style of Luke Kelly — while very drunk and possibly flatulent. She was moved. Or distracted. Either way, he’d become a father nine months later.</p>
    <p>But she left. Took the boy. Sent the odd photo, then silence.</p>
    <p>Until, two weeks ago, he’d seen the lad — now ten, wide-eyed and wary — at the post office with his aunt. The boy didn’t recognise him.</p>
    <p>So Norris did what he could.</p>
    <p>He bought socks.</p>
    <p>Grogan blinked. “That’s your gesture?”</p>
    <p>“They’re thermal,” Norris said defensively. “And on offer.”</p>
    <p>Brogan picked one up, sniffed it, and said, “This smells of missed opportunities.”</p>
    <p>They agreed to write the song.</p>
    <p>They debuted it that night. The pub was full. The fire roared. The socks hung behind the mic stand like relics.</p>
    <p><em>“Look lively, it’s Christmas time again, lad,<br>
    Isn’t it lovely to have socks from Dad…<br>
    Though you can’t remember his face,<br>
    His gift shows his heart’s in the right place.”</em></p>
    <p>There were giggles at first — then silence. A few sniffles. One barman whispered, “Ah Jesus,” into the till.</p>
    <p>Grogan ended with:</p>
    <p><em>“They’re an awful reddish hue,<br>
    And to look at them gives me a crackin’ headache too…”</em></p>
    <p>Norris stood up, nodded, and left without a word — leaving the socks behind like a votive offering.</p>
    <p>The song went modestly viral. People mailed socks to estranged loved ones with the lyrics printed on cards. Some were forgiven. Most were not.</p>
    <p>Grogan called it “a hymn to inadequate men.”</p>
    <p>Brogan called it “a wearable apology.”</p>
    <p>And Rainbow? She tried to eat one.</p>
    <p>The socks are now framed in a pub in Castlebar.</p>
    <p>A little plaque beneath reads:<br><strong>“He meant well.”</strong></p>

<!-- Story 3- Roses and Poitin-->

  <h2>🌹 The Fair at Ballymahone</h2>
  <h3>A Grogan & Brogan Love Story, Based on “Roses and Poitín”</h3>

  <img src="assets/Roses and Poitin.png" alt="Fairground scene with red-haired woman, poitín stall, and Grogan" class="story-image">

  <!-- Visible excerpt -->
  <p>They met at the fair.</p>
  <p>It was the kind of fair where you could buy a goat, a hurley, a tin whistle, and a third-hand philosophy degree — all before lunch.</p>
  <p>Grogan had been up all night composing a poem about mud. Brogan had lost his shoes in a wager involving a tin of mushy peas.</p>

  <!-- Hidden full content -->
  <div id="ballymahone-story-full" style="display: none;">
    <p>Then they saw her.</p>
    <p>She moved through the crowd like a banshee on holiday — all red hair, green coat, and fierce disregard.</p>
    <p>Grogan fell instantly in love. Brogan fell into a ditch.</p>
    <p>They followed her — not creepily, they insisted, but poetically.</p>
    <p>At the poitín stall, she scolded the vendor for overcharging.</p>
    <p>At the hay sculpture competition, she told a man his donkey looked depressed.</p>
    <p>At the kissing booth, she sat down behind the curtain and began to read <em>The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists</em>.</p>
    <p>“I think she’s my muse,” Grogan whispered.</p>
    <p>“She’s going to eat you alive,” Brogan replied, brushing straw from his ear.</p>
    <p>Grogan approached her with verse on his lips.</p>
    <p>He declaimed:</p>
    <p><em>“The Holy Mother of Jesus was never quite as fair,<br>
    As the woman I see now before me, standing over there…”</em></p>
    <p>She squinted at him. “Are you drunk?”</p>
    <p>He paused. “A bit.”</p>
    <p>She rolled her eyes. “Then pray to the Holy Mother you don’t throw up on my shoes.”</p>
    <p>He did not throw up. He wrote her a song instead.</p>
    <p><strong>“Roses and Poitín”</strong> — a waltz of whisky-fuelled yearning and poetic excess.</p>
    <p><em>“Perhaps it was the poitín that from my heart did wring,<br>
    This sad refrain which I then did proceed to sing…”</em></p>
    <p>He sang it in Ballymahone’s town square that night, slightly slurred but fully sincere.</p>
    <p>She listened, arms folded, chewing on a toffee.</p>
    <p>When he finished, the silence was thick as cream.</p>
    <p>Then she said: “That was the most idiotic thing I’ve ever heard.”</p>
    <p>She kissed him anyway.</p>
    <p>They lasted six weeks. Long enough for a short epic and two fights about Foucault.</p>
    <p>When she left, she gave Grogan a single red rose and a bottle of homemade poitín labelled <strong>“To remember me properly — in pain.”</strong></p>
    <p>The song became a favourite at wakes, weddings, and inebriated poetry slams.</p>
    <p>Grogan always introduced it with: “This is a cautionary tale. Never mix verse with illicit alcohol and strong women.”</p>
    <p>Brogan always muttered: “He loved it.”</p>
    <p>And somewhere in Ballymahone, when the wind is right, you can still hear a voice carried through the fairground stalls…</p>
    <p><em>“There is in this world a quality of things…<br>
    That becomes apparent when the blackbird sings…”</em></p>

  <h2>🍺 The Day Grogan Went to Grogan’s</h2>
  <h3>A Story of Dublin, Destiny, and Drink</h3>

  <img src="assets/GrogansPub.png" alt="Rainy Dublin pub front with an old man in a flat cap stepping inside" class="story-image">

  <!-- Visible excerpt -->
  <p>Grogan didn’t plan to go to Grogan’s that day — but then again, he rarely planned anything.</p>
  <p>It was a Thursday in March, the kind of day when the Liffey sulks and the gulls heckle passers-by.</p>
  <p>He’d come up from Ballymahone chasing a rumour — and possibly running from a woman named Deirdre.</p>

  <!-- Hidden full content -->
  <div id="groganspub-story-full" style="display: none;">
    <p>The pub was quieter than he expected — two lads arguing about the pronunciation of <em>Sligo</em>, a barmaid with poetry in her shoulders, and a jukebox muttering about Luke Kelly.</p>
    <p>Grogan paused beneath the rain-washed sign.</p>
    <p><strong>Grogan’s.</strong></p>
    <p>“Destiny or mischief,” he muttered, stepping inside.</p>

    <p>The barkeep eyed him. “Name?”</p>
    <p>“Grogan.”</p>
    <p>“No relation to…?”</p>
    <p>“Every relation.”</p>

    <p>He nursed his pint like a priest nurses a doubt — slowly, reverently, without letting it show.</p>
    <p>The pub whispered with stories — poets unpaid, rebels half-caught, and barflies who remembered Yeats as “a right sulk.”</p>
    <p>Grogan thought of his own songs — scrawled on ferry tickets, whispered to donkeys, ignored by Deirdre.</p>
    <p>He ordered another pint.</p>

    <p>Then she arrived — wild hair, boots muddy with ambition, and a voice like October wind.</p>
    <p>“You look like someone who writes laments,” she said, lighting a cigarette that defied logic and law.</p>
    <p>“I write things that start as jokes and end in prayer,” said Grogan.</p>
    <p>“That’ll do.” She clinked glasses with him.</p>

    <p>They didn’t speak much after that. Just sat there, two wrecks of old empires, listening to the city exhale.</p>

    <p>When Grogan left, the barmaid called out: “Come again!”</p>
    <p>He paused. “I never left.”</p>

    <p>He stepped into the rain, half legend, half regret, whistling something that might one day be a song.</p>
    <p><em>“I write things that start as jokes and end in prayer…”</em></p>
