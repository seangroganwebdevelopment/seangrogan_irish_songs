      <h2>Letter 1: On Leaving Ireland</h2>
      <p><em>Dear Sean,</em></p>
      <p>I left Ireland 20 years ago and never looked back. Your song "Boat for Boston" brought back so many memories...</p>
      <p>— Michael, Boston</p>
      <h3>Sean's Response:</h3>
      <p>Dear Michael,<br>I am moved that "Boat for Boston" reached you. Exile is a strange companion — it brings both freedom and loss...</p>

      <h2>Letter 2: How Do You Write?</h2>
      <p><em>Dear Sean,</em></p>
      <p>I’m fascinated by how your songs capture both sorrow and humor. Can you share how you approach songwriting?</p>
      <p>— Eimear, Dublin</p>
      <h3>Sean's Response:</h3>
      <p>Dear Eimear,<br>I often find that humor emerges from grief — they're inseparable. I try to let the song speak before I do...</p>

        <h2>Letter 4:  On the Power of Music</h2>
        <p><em>Dear Sean,</em></p>
        <p>Your songs move me deeply, especially those that blend humor with sadness. How do you balance the two without losing the emotional core?</p>
        <p>— Aisling, Cork</p>
        <h3>Sean's Response:</h3>
        <p>Dear Aisling,
            Music, to me, is a bridge between emotion and reflection. Humor and sadness, though seemingly opposite, often coexist in the Irish tradition. It's not about choosing one over the other but letting them intertwine. A song that makes you smile while making you think is, I believe, one of the most powerful expressions of life.
            
            I often start with a sincere feeling—a pang of loss, a memory of home, or a longing for connection. Humor naturally emerges when I step back and see the absurdity or irony within that pain. In a way, it’s like whistling in the dark—an instinctive way to cope with harsh realities.
            
            Balancing the two is more about being honest than clever. If a line feels forced, I drop it. I trust the melody to carry the emotion and let the words find their place, whether they be light-hearted or deeply poignant. Humor doesn’t negate sadness; it humanizes it.</p>

        <h2>Letter 5:  On Humour in your songs</h2>
        <p><em>Dear Sean,</em></p>
        <p>Your satirical songs make me laugh, but they also cut deep. How do you decide when a topic is fair game for satire?</p>
        <p>— Ciarán, Galway</p>
        <h3>Sean's Response:</h3>
        <p>Dear Ciarán,
            Humor in Irish music is never just a joke—it's a lens to see the truth. Satire works best when it hits close to the bone without becoming cruel. I’m drawn to subjects that are both serious and ridiculous, where there’s tension between what people say and what they truly feel.
            
            When I write a satirical song, I try to respect the humanity of the characters involved. Even when the tone is light, there’s an underlying respect for the pain or absurdity they’re dealing with. I don’t write to mock but to expose the contradictions that make us human.
            
            Satire should challenge, but it shouldn’t alienate. If a line feels too harsh or self-indulgent, I rethink it. The goal is to provoke thought while allowing space for empathy. Humor, when done right, connects us rather than divides us.</p>
