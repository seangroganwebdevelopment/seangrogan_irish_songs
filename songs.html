<h1>The Grogan & Brogan Manifesto</h1>
<h2>A Ballad in Prose</h2>

<p>We, Grogan & Brogan, Irish balladeers of the modern diaspora, hereby commit ourselves to ...</p>

    <section class="manifesto-entry">
      <strong>1. Songs That Remember.</strong>
      <p>We sing for the emigrants, the navvies, the ghost sons — the lost lovers, the unnamed dead. If a man died at sea, if a child never came home, if a woman held her family together with prayer and porter — we will sing their story.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="manifesto-entry">
      <strong>2. The Ridiculous and the Sacred.</strong>
      <p>In our world, a rodent in a lunchbox sits beside a famine lament. A drunken bear delivers theology. A donkey becomes a prophet. We laugh because it’s our inheritance. We weep because we remember.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="manifesto-entry">
      <strong>3. Dissonance and Devotion.</strong>
      <p>Grogan writes. Brogan riffs. We argue, we harmonize, we get it wrong and we get it right. That’s the duet. That’s the magic.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="manifesto-entry">
      <strong>4. Invention, Not Imitation.</strong>
      <p>We honour tradition, but we do not freeze it. We echo the sean-nós, the wake-room poet, the kitchen revolutionary — but we speak to now.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="manifesto-entry">
      <strong>5. Satire is a Sacrament.</strong>
      <p>From “Drunken Paddy” to “Rodent in the Lunchbox,” we never separate mockery from meaning. Satire is our love language. Irreverence is a form of reverence.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="manifesto-entry">
      <strong>6. The Song Isn’t Finished.</strong>
      <p>Brogan vanished. Grogan stayed. But the project sings on. The donkey hasn’t brayed its final note. The stash still overflows.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="manifesto-entry">
      <strong>7. We Bring the Songs Home.</strong>
      <p>To Ireland. To Luxembourg. To Africa. To hall and hearth, schoolyard and shoreline. If there are ears, we will sing. If there is silence, we’ll fill it.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="manifesto-entry">
      <strong>8. The Stash Is Sacred.</strong>
      <p>These are not just songs. They are lived truths. “The Exile’s Lament,” “Sleep Well Lads,” “England,” “The Artist” — this is our shared heartbeat.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="manifesto-entry">
      <strong>9. We Remember Brogan.</strong>
      <p>Wherever he is — Donegal? Zanzibar? Another melodic dimension? His spirit is in every chord, every silence, every wrong note made true.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="manifesto-entry">
      <strong>10. We Are Not Finished.</strong>
      <p>The fire is lit. The stories keep arriving. The donkey keeps braying. The next verse waits.</p>
    </section>
